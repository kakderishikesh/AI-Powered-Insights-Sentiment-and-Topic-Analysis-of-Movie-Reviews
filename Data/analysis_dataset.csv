3.0,Some decent moments...but...,"Annabella Sciorra did her character justice with her portrayal of a mentally ill, depressed and traumatized individual who projects much of her inner wounds onto others. The challenges she faces with her father were sensitively portrayed and resonate with understanding and love. The ending really isn't an ending, though and feels like it was abandoned with not enough of a closure but other than that, its a decent movie to sit through if you're the type of person who likes to people-watch or analyze the actions of others. Has an independent-movie feel which is also somewhat comforting.",[],B096Z8Z3R6,B096Z8Z3R6,AG2L7H23R5LLKDKLBEF2Q3L2MVDA,1646271834582,0,True

In simple words this movie inspires very deep emotions and just might motivate you to do that thing you've been procrastinating on for too long.

Miguel is such a cute kid and REAL.<br /><br />Personal Opinion: Reading some of the lower star reviews really irks me because they do not understand the culture, religion, or concept. If you don't get it, that is fine, but don't base your reviews of the movie based on your own religion/culture. For goodness sake, its a child's film.

1.0,A great career while it lasted,"Finally settled in last night to watch this movie. Let me start by saying that I love a good mystery and that I usually enjoy these kind of movies. Not much more can I say that hasn't been said before. First, the acting was absolutely awful. The movie is so scripted, it's almost as if the actors are reading their lines. The roles and characters are more than predictable (i.e. you have all token nationalities in the 'bad guy' gang, so they are equal opportunity offenders). I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical. The underlying piece of Kim's marriage to an abusive man, was also ridiculously scripted and acted (damn, if any housewife kept a house as dirty and junk filled as she did, who wouldn't be yelling at her from time to time?). Anyway, just reliving this movie to write this review is painful. The movie was like a bad Saturday Night Live/MadTV skit. Run, don't walk, from buying or even renting this one.",[],B001QMCJ14,B001QMCJ14,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1240772192000,2,False
4.0,"Not exactly like the book, but good just the same","I bought the DVD of Angela's Ashes after purchasing the audio CD of the book (which I highly, highly recommend). Starting with the audion CD, I was enthralled in listening to Frank McCourt's own voice (almost as if he was telling his whole childhood story just to me). I actually was so disappointed when the book ended (because it had me so captivated), I couldn't wait to see the movie. So, I bought it. Now, the strengths of the movie are that you get to see some beautifulm and tragic, areas of  where the McCourts came from. The acting was pretty good. The bad part for me was that it seemed so depressing. It was raining constantly (which I know it does frequently in Ireland, but not every day and all the time. Even the audio CD talked of days with sunshine. I think the creator/director of the movie was trying awfully hard to make the McCourt's childhood similar to people living in some kind of an abusive/prison type setting. The audio CD had me laughing out loud at some of the most tragic parts of his life, as Frank inserted his phenominal sense of humor into everything. I didn't seem to get that same feel from the movie. Many scenes that were discussed in the book were either left out or glossed over in the movie all together. After hearing the CD, I felt enlightened, enchanted, craving to hear more of his life (so, I bought 'TIS last week). The movie just wanted to make me cry and get on my knees to thank God I wasn't raised in that area of Ireland during the 1940's. I recommend it only if you have read/are going to read the real book behind this. It is worth seeing to be able to relate to the town and scenery that you will hear/read about in the book.",[],0792163087,0792163087,AFSKPY37N3C43SOI5IEXEK5JSIYA,1208560454000,6,True

It’s one thing to show the couple’s having an issue here and there but the whole season has been about Clara being angry with Jesse and with Faith making sure Carson knows how much he keeps messing up. Elizabeth's character is the most unlikeable person at this point. She is rude, bitter and all around totally unpleasant.

5.0,It was good,"Many people who left a one star review of this movie obviously didn't even watch it and this is not the type of movie you can tell what the rest of the movie will give you just by watching the first hand full of minutes. **Spoilers** Yes the whole Samuel L. Jackson thing was strange, but after you get past that, it gets better. And if you watch it you’ll see how they dress up as Pulp Fiction characters and they watch Pulp Fiction in the movie, maybe if you don’t get this movie, you wouldn’t get that because you certainly wouldn’t appreciate Tarantino movies if you find so much fault with Life Itself. That being said, this movie moves through the lives of many people who are connected. There is a lot of death but death is part of life and I guess I focused more on the living and loving part. The love story of Sergio and Isabel is beautiful but somewhat tragic, he felt he couldn’t give her or his son what they needed so he left. It was sad that he gave his son his dream vacation by taking him to New York but they met with tragedy that forever changed them. I think none of them could ever get over what happened there, they moved on in their own way but how do you fully come back from something like that? Listening to Isabel tell Rigo goodbye was one of the most beautiful things I've heard. Everything she says to him is the truth, we live on in others and when we die, we are still here, in them. It was very touching and when she hugged him but it showed him as a little boy, I could relate.

That being said, all the boys did a fine job acting in it. I was in a group of 4 girls that reminded me of the four boys in the movie. We all came from somewhat different families but yet were best friends. I kept in touch with a couple of them throughout school but just like in the movie, you grow apart and that is just life.

Elizabeth is torn between the two men but none of them have any real chemistry.

1.0,Why isn't it getting better?,"I miss what this show started out being. It was fun and relatable to a degree. It had so much potential but sadly it’s not getting better with time. Diana is by far the best character at this point, she is the only one who is really evolving into someone new that we all love to root for. Liza and Charles are finally together but why, they have NO chemistry and they are not enjoyable to watch. Watching them kiss is almost painful! Liza could totally flourish and she should be living her life for herself. Any woman who has been through a divorce knows you need at least a year after your divorce is final to figure out who you are again without someone else tieing you down or getting in your way. Liza is not finding herself like she started out to do. She is so worried about what man she is with or busy kissing Kelsey’s butt that the show is forgetting what it’s supposed to be about!<br /><br />Kelsey is more of the same, her character is not moving forward, she is a boring little know it all snob who thinks she knows what the world is really about. What has she really experienced other than a few failed relationships and a few one night stands? Her character is not likeable at this point and she is totally undeserving of her promotions with the company.<br /><br />And Josh, well, like many other viewers have expressed, he’s a crybaby! He is not fun to watch and honestly, his character is just getting old. Maggie is great, if they’d do more of a story line on her, that’d be entertaining. She is way too strong of a woman for the way they are portraying her. Laura is fun but her character this last season was boring and it felt like she was overacting in most of her scenes. And lastly, who casted Caitlin? She is the most annoying person on this show. She is not a good actress and she comes across as an annoying little brat that adds nothing to the show.<br /><br />I've watched the show since the first episode but I doubt I'll continue.

My grandsons (currently 8 and 11) love them and so do I! I was excited to be able to purchase this while it was still in theaters as we don't go to theaters much any more.

I prefer listening to the french and watching the dub because I love hearing french being spoken.  I've watched both ways - works with English dub over too.  As a werewolf movie fan, I watched this movie and it did NOT disappoint - even though it's not really a werewolf movie - there are wolves.  It's a little 'off Broadway' as they say - but I thought the production was good and the story is compelling.  It's not going to win Oscars for all, but it is entertaining and isn't that what it's all about.  Things are not as they seem in this story - I hesitate to give too many details so as not to give away the end.  It is rated R for violence, gore, language, nudity, some sexual content - so it's not really for the very young ones or people with weak constitutions. For adults,  in my opinion, it's worth a watch.

And reminds you to think about the men and women who risk their lives to save others at sea.  You have to go out... but you don't have to come back.  Yikes.  That about says it all.  Heroes all.

It is enlightening... and in some ways made me appreciate the movies a bit more.  I love Jennifer Lawrence... she is a young lady with a future.

Just my humble opinion... but then I am not a movie reviewer, just a movie watcher.

Honestly it was the spectical of the movie.. the special effects and the story that drew me in to actually purchase the movie. I saw in the theater and the scene of all the sperm whales in the ocean was... breath taking... Can you just imagine when it was actually like that?? The movie is the story of the writing of Moby Dick.  So much more than just Moby Dick.  If you liked Moby Dick you will find this interesting too.

I think Jennifer Aniston doesn't get enough credit for being pretty funny on her own, although I am not her biggest fan... I also recommend Horrible Bosses 1 and 2 (on the line of Hangover), and if you're an Aniston fan - Wanderlust.  So that gives you a hint at my sense of humor.

This is a truly funny movie... although I think Horrible 2 is even more funny, this one remains funny after watching it more than once.  If you get this one, you've got to get 2.  I watched while on a very long plane trip recently... I had watched &#34;Still Alice (a HORRIBLY sad movie) and REALLY needed some laughs...  I watched Horrible 2 and laughed out loud enough for the flight attendant to ask what I was watching...  Yep.. it was funny enough to laugh out loud.  And so is this one.

In fact, I prefer Horrible 2 to the first one. The cast is well matched and while I am not a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, she plays it well.  Being a chick, I find this type of silly/idiot male humor particularly amusing I guess.  It's worth a view if you like to laugh and male humor.  And obviously I thought good enough to buy it.

5.0,Worth the conversation,"Wow.  There are a lot of really intense reviews about this movie.  Please remember that we all have the right to have an opinion and I am not trying to make any one change their minds or believe the way I do.<br />First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.<br />Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their &#34;side.&#34;<br />That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.<br />I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.<br />I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as &#34;killer whales&#34; are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded &#34;attack&#34; on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique &#34;personalities&#34;... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a &#34;trainer.&#34;  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their &#34;trainers.&#34;<br />I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.

Please don't edit things in the direction of what only you all see behind the story.  Show us the real, and let us be the judge.  Thats what i thought reality TV was.?  But i am new to this concept.  But i also have worked in live TV and know what a huge difference it can make when different pics are put with different comments.  Give us the respect to make our own judgements w all the facts. AMAZING series and it will stand on its own.

5.0,Hooray For UNEDITED DVD Releases!!,"I can't really review this particular set yet, because it has not been released. I will make comments based on the previous sets I've purchased. Just like many others viewers of L.H., I was disappointed that Lionsgate did not plan to release the last 3 seasons on Blu-ray. However, I want to state this; I would rather have this show in its UNEDITED form on DVD than not have it at all. Yes, there are some differences in the Blu-ray and DVD qualities, especially the bigger screen you have. As for me, I would rather get to watch scenes from this show that I have not seen since the original broadcasts in the 70's and 80's. If Lionsgate had released L.H. ONLY in DVD form, but with all scenes intact, I would have bought every set. Compared to the former Imavision releases on DVD, there is no comparison. When I watch the recent released DVDs, I feel like I am watching a new show, because so many scenes were restored and added back in! Tvshowsondvd.com just released the new about Season 8 a few days ago, and this set will include the movie The Last Farewell and one other movie. I'm looking forward to getting it; I've been well-pleased with the other seven DVD seasons, so I don't expect to be disappointed with this one!",[],B017RR78TY,B017RR78TY,AF3HNAQK2URNEBAZQCRZGSPBU5FQ,1448735264000,9,False

4.0,Important Movie with Historical Significance; Highly Recommended,"Not many movies come along these days that I can recommend without any hesitation.  This is one.  Based on a true story, which I always find interesting, it tells of the women; particularly the black women who performed much of the complicated math involved in getting our astronauts out into space and back again safely.  It shows the struggles they went through for acceptance.  You NEED this movie in your collection, if for no other reason than to help complete your knowledge of unknown or little known history.  As usual, with true stories, there were some liberties taken with the facts, but for the most part the story is true.  I only knocked off one star from a 5-star rating due to the fact that even though it was very entertaining, it wasn't one of those movies that if you didn't see it you would be missing out on something incredible.  A wonderful movie that I highly recommend, but not an incredible one; very close to it, though.  A 5+ rating for the historical significance.",[],B01LTI1RHG,B01LTI1RHG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1486242739000,1,False
2.0,"Boring, Mediocre Musical, Good Romance","This is one of the most boring movies I have ever watched.  It has some decent music and dance numbers, but nothing that memorable.  It's basically a romance and about trying to succeed.  Positive themes, but not that entertaining.  Maybe people thought this was good since we haven't had any good musicals in a long time.  The acting was okay too.  Not much to say negative against the movie, but it probably would be most interesting to14 year old girls.  There isn't much of a plot and not much to hold your interest.  It is a good movie for your young teens or even kids, as it is a good wholesome movie.  Just too boring for me and I often like a good romantic movie sometimes and I like good musicals too.  There just wants anything magic about this movie.",[],B01LTI1WA8,B01LTI1WA8,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1486242078000,12,False
5.0,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty, Hard Life Story","One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has, especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco, a homely, white-haired, rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot, which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country, but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere, there are good and bad people in the country, just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie; not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie, you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair, even at 17.  And some dirt; she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness, cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times, as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example, ""Teardrop"", the brother-in-law of the main character, sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie, buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie; 5 stars for the soundtrack.",[],B003EYVXTG,B003EYVXTG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1288541755000,0,False
2.0,Good Ideas Don't Always Make Great Entertainment,"Three generations of Hispanic women (Grandmother, mother and daughter) struggle through their relationships with men and sexual encounters in a small town.  The grandmother, having lost her husband a long time ago craves the attention of her gardener who helps her learn to drive. The mother, divorced, struggles with her feelings toward men and how intimate and involved she dares to get (and with whom).  The daughter is just starting out with her sexual feelings and has her first sexual union.  The ideas presented here seem to transcend race or culture and could apply fully to any women; not just Hispanic women.  The movie is bold and explores territory that makes one think about how men and women relate to each other sexually in a way that not many movies do.  Sex is so casual in many movies; here it is taken seriously and not lightly.  I would say it was thoughtful and thought-provoking movie.  A couple of the scenes seemed unnecessarily long and a little uncomfortable to watch (the grandmother bathing and the mother pleasuring herself with a toy, even though you only see her face, so it's not that explicit).  The primary problem with the movie is that it just isn't very entertaining and it plods along so slowly.  It's a very boring movie and that's a shame, because it could have been an important movie, if it had been done a bit differently.  It's a good exploration of the human condition, even though very poorly done.",[],B001BEK8JM,B001BEK8JM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1270532210000,1,False
5.0,Better Than I Could Have Ever Hoped For,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was really blown away by it.  It's a wonderful family movie for all ages.  The music, while not quite my cup of tea, is actually quite good.  Clean, wholesome fun by kids who are driven to make some music and win a competition.  No raunchy stuff and no toilet talk by oversexed teens.  It's a quality teen movie for a change, rather than the tripe that Hollywood often puts out.  There is some ""formula"" and predictable things, but there are also a few surprises.<br />It has a few mildly comic moments, but I wouldn't call it a funny movie.<br />Overall ranked next to other excellent movies, it's probably not a 5-star movie, but I rated it that way as it is excellent in the high school teen movie category.  I have never seen anything as good in this category.  Lots of fun and very satisfying overall.  Just so you know, I am a 62 year old man and I enjoyed the movie a great deal, but I think kids as young as 12 will like this movie and there isn't anything inappropriate for that age.  Wish they made more movies like this.",[],B0021L8UT4,B0021L8UT4,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1270186234000,4,False
1.0,Could Have Been a Whole Lot Better,"Who were they trying to reach with this movie?  There are a lot of movies made these days that appeal to both kids and adults and many succeed in that.  This is NOT one of them, if that's what they were trying to accomplish.  For the most part I don't see this as appealing to kids or adults.  The ""wild"" creatures were somewhat interesting at times, but sort of a cross between frightening, freaky and comic.  There are too many problems with this movie.  Bratty kid trying to get attention runs away after biting his mother, jumps in a boat and just happens upon an island with strange creatures.  He isn't the least bit curious about or afraid of these creatures who are 5 times his size and who initially want to eat him?  Give me a break.  When he leaves, again in the boat, he is able to find his way home without any problem.  How?  There is no logic to this movie.  They should leave this kind of movie to the Disney people who probably could have done a much better job with the story.  Too many holes in the story.  Nothing is resolved.  The only thing I found interesting was the music, but the music didn't seem to go with the movie. There were a couple of things in the movie that I thought were totally inappropriate for children; one was when one of the creatures knocks down two owls, mid-flight with rocks.  The creature then says, ""They like it when I do that"".  She picks up the stunned owls and puts one under each arm.  Apparently they are not injured.  In another scene one creature rips the arm off another.  While it is not too gruesome, it's a stupid, unnecessary scene.  The music and the movie were both totally weird.  This is a freaky, niche movie that probably won't do very well over time.  Not recommended to anyone.  Hard to believe that some people actually thought this was a good movie.  It could have been much better with some serious tweaking, as it had all the elements that could have made it great.  It's just that they didn't know how to put them together correctly.  I haven't read the book, but I am sure it was delightful in comparison to this mess.",[],B001HN699A,B001HN699A,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1268091147000,11,False
1.0,LOUSY,"Potentially could have been a great film, but the shaky hand-held camera work made it difficult to watch.  The second major problem was that most of the action in the film was in almost complete darkness.  It was so dark that you could barely make out anything.  What a waste of film.  You would have thought after they shot a roll or so of film, they would have realized it was just too dark and would have re-shot that portion and used more light in future shooting.  Nope.  It never gets any lighter.  Could have been a great horror film if you could have seen what was happening.  Also the ending was so ambiguous that it was impossible to figure out what actually happened.  A complete and total waste of time.  Not even as good as Blair Witch Project, which I hated.  The costumes, the actors and the locale were all great, but totally wasted.",[],B002IW8V04,B002IW8V04,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1265151930000,4,False
5.0,Brilliant - Not the Same Old Stuff,"This is not light, fluffy happy Christmas fare.  Holidays for many are lonely, depressing and sad.  This movie brilliantly portrays that sadness and loneliness in a very realistic and believable way.  So who wants to watch a depressing Christmas movie?  The hopelessness and lack of joy turns into hope and joy when people do the right thing and do little random acts of kindness, even when it doesn't seem like it makes any difference.  Amazingly both in this movie and in real life, just a little kindness often goes a long way to change hardened hearts and sad, lonely people.  The movie works because it truly demonstrates that there is still a lot of hope, even for those who seem to lost all hope.  Superb casting, especially Stephen Baldwin.  Truly uplifting, even though not a bright and cheery movie.  I got a lump in my throat at the end.  It's not a dramatic ending; just a quiet and pleasant ending.  Sometimes it is nice to have everything all wrapped up in a nice pleasant package at the end of a movie.  You won't get there here, but the movie wouldn't work well if it was done that way.  Instead, you just kind of instinctively know that the people who had lost their way, are going to be okay now.  They will be okay because strangers cared enough to give then just a little of their time and attention and do the right thing.",[],B000VZADOM,B000VZADOM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1259648618000,2,False
5.0,Can Ron Howard Make a Bad Movie?,"Everything Ron Howard touches seems to turn into gold.  I can't recall him making a bad movie.  Frost/Nixon is probably one of his better efforts.  A top cast, good writing and a superb director (Howard), makes this a movie you won't want to miss.  Frank Langella as Nixon does a fantastic job.  Instead of trying to impersonate Nixon, Langella BECOMES Nixon.  It was the right choice.  There have been so many bad and comic impressions of Nixon.  If Langella had tried to do that, the movie probably would have failed.  Instead of trying to look and sound like Nixon, he gets into Nixon's heart and soul.",[],B001TH92N4,B001TH92N4,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1241071960000,0,False
4.0,"Slow & plodding, but worth it for the ending","It's hard to say much about this movie without spoiling it for someone who hasn't seen it.  It does seem to move a bit slow for the first hour or so and has flashbacks that you don't quite understand.  It all becomes clear by the end.  It's not exactly a surprise ending, but perhaps not quite what you would expect either.  The last 1/2 hour is worth sitting through the first hour or so.  Most of the movies I have seen Will Smith in are much lighter fare.  Even Pursuit of Happyness was somewhat lighter than this movie.  Smith pulls it off extremely well and shows he can do darker, more serious roles with the same expertise at comedic ones.  He has really developed as a serious actor, pulling away from some of his sillier roles.  Rosario Dawson is superb as well.  The casting and the acting is a solid 5 stars.  This is not a movie to watch when you are down and depressed, but is one to renew your faith in the goodness of some people and how much they are willing to give to others.<br />It's a hard movie to recommend because one can't be quite sure how others will react to it.  It has a bittersweet ending; you are sad, but at the same time uplifted.  The movie didn't make me cry, but it really should have.  For pure entertainment value, it was slightly lacking, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.",[],B001QERPAC,B001QERPAC,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1241071133000,0,False
5.0,A good movie for the whole family,"I was afraid I might be disappointed in this movie, but it turned out to be really worthwhile.  I have no children, but as an adult I enjoyed this very much.  It doesn't have quite as many ""side jokes"" for adults as something like Shrek, but there are still a few very funny moments.  The animation is very good.  I watched in on computer screen and the picture was extremely clear.  Animation has come a long way through the years and this is just about as good as it gets.  The soundtrack is nice, the choice of voices is excellent.  I got a real hoot out of Carol Burnett as the voice of the cranky kangaroo.  Of course it helps if you know her work. Jim Carey was outstanding as the voice of Horton.  Not a boring moment in the movie and something that an entire family can enjoy. Even the teens will probably like this one.

5.0,Enjoyed This Much More Than I Ever Expected,"I never expected to enjoy this concert as much as I did.  This is a very high energy concert with Selena dancing and singing for around 50 minutes.  She never stops moving for the entire concert and it is never boring. I was worried when she came out singing in English at the start, but the remainder of the songs after the first medley are in Spanish.  I don't know much Spanish, but her singing is the best in Spanish, even though she does very well in English too.  Anyone who likes good popular music should enjoy this concert.  The DVD also has a nice feature that is quite interesting on the making of the movie about Selena's life.  I have seen the movie and it wasn't overly impressive, but this feature shows how much effort went into that movie and how much they tried to keep it as authentic as possible.  A really nice bonus would have been to include the movie too, make it a 2-volume set or even a 3-volume by including the CD soundtrack of the concert. In any case, this DVD is a must for Selena fans, but would easily be enjoyed by those who have never heard of Selena.

2.0,Very Strange Story,"Tell me what you think of this plot:  A child comes back to life to confront the mother who cut her throat, only she is a grown woman, but still talks like a child.  Meanwhile this so-called ghost manages to seduce her mother's ""boyfriend"" who has come back after 18 years.  The ghost manages to get pregnant by him.  Then the ""ghost"", totally naked and pregnant is brought out on the front porch by her mother and disappears in a couple of minutes when a group of church ladies start chanting and singing spiritual songs from the road in front of the house.  Then the mother goes into depression for having lost the child that has come back to her and her other daughter goes to work for rich white folks to support herself and her mother.  That's Beloved in a nutshell.  And let's not forget another ghost that you don't see at all; just her poltergeist activity, except you do see that ghost in the flesh near the end of the movie (and in flashbacks to a prior time).  And people think this is a great movie?  It's a very strange movie and I couldn't tell what the message was supposed to be, if there even was one.  The one redeeming thing about the movie is the period costumes and scenery, which is very beautifully done.  It takes place in the 1800's and you certainly do feel that you have been taken back in time.",[],0788815474,0788815474,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1223180834000,2,False

There is a lot to this movie and yet it is a not a complicated plot.  An English grower is in India without his wife and falls for the beautiful house girl (played by the absolutely gorgeous and wonderful Nandita Das).  The grower's wife shows up with their son and the house girl's husband finds out she is having an affair.  Without spoiling the movie, it is enough to say that everyone pays a terrible price in the end for this affair.  Some of the Merchant Ivory productions are slow and boring.  This one keeps you wondering how it is going to turn out.  The end is tragic, but there couldn't have been any other ending.  The movie is a little slow in places, but never boring.

1.0,Huh?,"Isn't the main idea of a movie to ENTERTAIN, even if the film maker is trying to deliver a message or educate?  Crash is not entertaining and I couldn't figure out the message (if there was one).  Perhaps the message is that racism still exists in America.  So who doesn't know that already?  There were too many characters in this movie and no hero or person that we could identify with.  What WERE the critics thinking?  Makes you wonder sometimes how the critics can sometimes be so far out of touch with what the public likes.  Makes me begin to wonder why we even listen to the critics, as they too often get it wrong.  This is another one of those soulless movies that critics seem to adore (such as No County for Old Men, another waste of time).  Not even the big stars can rescue this stinker.  Did anyone read the script before they agreed to be in this?  Amazes me that this is one of the most rented movies from Blockbuster.

4.0,Wonderful Performances; Slightly Boring Overall,"The performances in this movie are all 5-star.  I knocked off one star on my overall review, because the movie just wasn't quite as entertaining as I thought it could have been.  Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and does a wonderful job in the role, but Martin Landau stole the show with his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  You forget you are watching Landau and actually start believing you are seeing Lugosi.  The movie is shot in black & white, which I thought would be a big downer, but it didn't detract from the movie in the least.  I forgot I was watching a black & white movie.  Ed Wood struggles and struggles and you keep hoping he will make it big, but you know in the back of your mind that he is never going to.  A lot of people will probably pass up this movie because it's not a big exciting extravaganza.  It's not really inspirational.  It's not funny, other than a couple of light moments.  In many ways I would say that it is a wonderful tribute to a man who never gave up on his dream.  His persistence and his lack of ability to never make a really good movie has earned him a unique place in movie history.  Perhaps not the way he wanted to be remembered, but he is remembered and maybe in the end that's all anyone can really hope for.",[],B0000VD04M,B0000VD04M,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1209969096000,0,False

What really was a surprise to me was what a great job Julia Roberts did in portraying the rich Texas socialite who influenced Wilson.  It always seemed to me she was good at ditzy blonde roles and perhaps not much else.  She proved otherwise in this movie.  Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Gust Avrakotos was the best and apparently he was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor.  The movie really points out that ordinary people, even those with serious character flaws can be true heroes.

5.0,Superb Acting and a Good Story,"Although some of the things shown in the movie were not true and the character of Billy Sunday was a composite of several people and not a real person, the important basic facts were true and remarkable.  Carl Brashear did in fact lose a leg from a shipboard accident and did come back from that tradegy to become a master diver with an artificial leg.  And he faced a lot of racism.  The man had super-human determination.  He actually wrote 100's of letters to even get admitted to diving school, as  told in the movie.  He is a true hero and this is a very inspirational movie.  I had never taken Cuba Gooding, Jr. very seriously, probably because of having seen him in light comedies before this.  He proved himself more than capable of handling a difficult, dramatic role.  He is still not a matured actor and has a way to go to be as good as more seasoned actors.  In spite of that, he really pulled off this role very well.  De Niro does a wonderful job too as the unrelenting trainer.  Yes, there are some things in the movie that seem a bit contrived, but it didn't bother me because I knew I was watching the story of a great hero.  Even though some facts were distorted, it does not diminish in any way the remarkable achievements of Carl Brashear.",[],B00003CXPP,B00003CXPP,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1209453005000,1,False
2.0,Very Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first two Pirate movies and was anticipating a nice resolution to the unsatisfying ending of Dead Man's Chest (2nd one).  I think that poor old Walt Disney must be turning over in his grave to know that this 3rd installment bears his name.  While it was entertaining in many places, it was a incoherent mess.  It certainly didn't need an early scene in which a young pirate boy was hung; it added nothing to the movie and seemed pointless.  ""Daddy, why did they hang that boy?""  ""Gee son, I don't really know.""  Johnny Depp was his usually charming self, but they didn't seem to know what to do with him this time and he stumbles through the movie not really seeming to be a major character.  This version throws in everything but the kitchen sink.  No wait, I think there might be a kitchen sink too.  It just doesn't work.  They tried to do too much and got crazy in the process.  Don't waste your time on this one.  I think there is to be a 4th movie.  I don't know how that could be any good and straighten things out after this mess.  It's not a total loss, but wasn't nearly as much fun to watch as the first two.  It even got silly on the supernatural stuff at times.  People don't mind some supernatural if it makes sense.  This did not.  Skip this one; you'll be very disappointed.",[],B000U7WV1Y,B000U7WV1Y,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1199317982000,1,False

Others just didn't cut it, such as Happy Feet or Surf's Up.  Meet the Robinsons falls somewhere in between the good and the bad.  I just don't think it has enough to keep the kids interested for the whole movie.  One reviewer complained about the simplistic plot.  I thought it got a little complicated at the end for younger kids.  There is some funny stuff here, but not as funny as many of the other good animated features.  The animation quality seemed a bit poor at a couple of places too.  The plot seemed like a cross between Robots and Back to the Future.

The movie made no sense whatsoever and I had no idea what they were getting at or talking about 99% of the time.  The movie drifts between following the life of a photographer who seems to be hallucinating and interviews with people talking absurdly about quantum physics and quantum mechanics and what is real and what isn't.  Near as I can tell the point of the movie seemed to be to try and convince us that reality is created by the chemicals in our brains.  There are lots of colorful journeys though the brain and body too that look very psychedelic.  I have never taken hallucinogens, but I imagine that they could produce something like this movie.

4.0,Flawed but thought provoking,"Up front I'll say that I am very right wing conservative.  Michael Moore's political views are generally reprehensible to me.  With that being said, Sicko is a pretty good attempt at showing how bad our health care system can be at times.  It also makes obvious what many of us really already know; that insurance companies run health care these days.  My experience is that most insurance companies are reasonably fair, but there are situations where they truly do decide who lives or dies.  The movie delves a little into other topics such as free education.  It's definitely a liberal, socialist agenda that Moore is pushing here, but even for the most staunch right-winger the movie is well worth watching for the ideas that it brings up and for many nuggets of truth.  Some of it is a bit absurd, such as pointing to Cuba's outstanding health care system.  Would anyone really want to go to Cuba to get free health care since everything else there sucks big time?  Would Moore himself go there for treatment?  I'll bet he wouldn't.  We do have things that need fixing in our health care system, but I don't think that letting the government take it over is going to be a good thing.  Have they ever done anything that well?  Anyway, watch the movie; it's thought provoking and well worth the time to see it and think about whether or not socialized medicine is going to really solve all our problems.  I saw the movie described as Michael Moore's funniest movie.  There are amusing moments, but I wouldn't call it a funny movie.

2.0,Worst Animated Feature Made in Recent Times,"This movie has excellent animation.  Unfortunately that's about the only thing good about it.  Guess I should have known that surfing penguins is just too far out.  Very boring, ill-conceived and very little creative imagination went into this.  Happy Feet was bad enough, but now this piece of junk is released.  Who did they make this for?  Boring for both adults and kids.  Even the adult humor is not very classy.  Do you want the kids to see a movie where one of the baby penguins describes one of the adults as a stinking trash can full of p**p?  Or how about the method of curing a wound from stepping on a spiny sea creature?  You cure it by p**ing on it.  One of the penguins does, although you don't see it; you just hear the water running.  Kids will come up with enough bathroom phrases on their own without this movie adding to their ideas on how to be disgusting and gross.  The format is a documentary about various animal surfers.  It just does not work.  A chicken is also a surfer.  Weird and strange and not funny or interesting.  There is a spindly-legged bird and a squirrel (or some fuzzy little creature) and a band of cannibal penguins that make this a little more interesting, but nothing could save this groaner.  Too bad, as the animation was very good; it was just wasted on a lot of very bad ideas.

5.0,"Moving, Emotional and Hard to Watch at Times","Too often remade movies are just not as good as the originals.  This is a notable exception.  This appears to be a lot longer than the first movie and goes into much more detail after the capture.  The harsh nature of the concentration camps after the capture makes this difficult to watch at times.  Kingsley is superb as the father, Otto Frank.  The girl playing Anne Frank is absolutely wonderful too and even looks somewhat like Anne Frank's pictures.  All the cast was excellent.  I liked the original movie, but this is so much better.  I don't know how much was factual, but having seen the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, I have to say that they really did seem to accurately depict what it looked like; probably made a replica or even possibly filmed it there on site.  The only inaccuracy that I picked up was that they showed who betrayed the Franks; however, that has never been determined with any certainty.  It is a mystery to this day.  The movie feels like it drags on and on and it is a bit slow in places.  It is probably best watched in two parts.  In spite of any minor shortcomings, this is a 5-star movie.  Bring your box of hankies.  It is highly emotional and very sad at the end.  Holocaust deniers should be forced to sit through this movie over and over again, as well as visit some of the still remaining camps.  I visited Dachau last year and seeing it has a profound impact on a person.  Anne Frank reminds us how brutal things can be for the innocent in a war.  I wouldn't watch this with sensitive young children, as it might be too upsetting for them.  I think you will be moved by this film and it should be a part of everyone's film library.  Watch it when you are feeling sorry for yourself and you'll realize just how good things are for you.",[],B00005LC5R,B00005LC5R,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1194388028000,1,False
3.0,Very Funny Adult Comedy,"This movie had some very funny laugh out loud moments and was entertaining all the way through.  I am not sure that a gay person would find it quite as funny as a straight person, as there were some stereotype ideas that were used to get laughs.  A good example is when all the firemen are in the shower and a couple of them drop their soap.  Knowing they have two among them who they think are gay, no one wants to bend over to pick up the soap.  Or when they are shopping to pick up items that are more ""gay"" than what they usually would buy.  I can't say that the movie makes fun of gays, as eventually everyone in the firehouse accepts the fact that they have gays working with them and eventually supports them.  Some politically incorrect moments end up being ""corrected"" by the end of the movie.  This is definitely an adult movie with adult themes, although older teens who really know what ""gay"" means probably wouldn't be shocked by anything here.  I wouldn't take my mom to see the movie and probably not my wife either.  The plot seems a bit of a stretch--that two guys had to get married to protect a pension.  I would have thought they could have found a much easier way.  It does make for a lot of comical moments such as when a very picky inspector says that their trash is not ""gay"" enough.  Some fundamentalists might be bothered by the fact that this movie is just another step closer to our acceptance in this society of openly gay behavior as being completely okay.  I think I feel as most Americans do; that what two consenting adults do behind closed doors is their own business.  What people do in public or if it involves children is different matter all together.  One of the guys in the movie does have children but the movie handles it very well and the two guys are very keenly aware of protecting the children.  When one of the children is asked what it is like to have two daddies, she says ""I don't have two daddies.  I have my daddy and my uncle.""  Solid 3 star movie; couldn't in good conscience quite give it 4 stars.",[],B000VXWX7E,B000VXWX7E,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1193701502000,2,False
3.0,Classic Western Comedy,"Several years before the classic Blazing Saddles, the Trinity movies were blazing their own trails into western comedy.  Shiftless, dirty and lazy Trinity rides into town on his back on a makeshift bed dragged by his horse.  He meets up with his outlaw brother who encourages him to do something with his life, such as become a horse thief like he is.  His reply is that he is just too busy doing nothing!  He and his brother are both the fastest guns in the west.  His brother shoots 3 men before they can even unholster their weapons.  Trinity too is very fast on the draw and shoots people coming up behind him or above him with lightening speed.  Sounds a bit violent, but their speed and ability to fight with superhuman strength is amusing and funny at times.  When I first saw this movie years ago I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen, but it doesn't quite stand up well over time.  Decent plot involving a bad guy trying to drive Mormon farmers out of a valley that he wants for his horses.  A couple of minor surprises here and there and some funny stuff.  Nice title song too. Well worth owning as a classic to watch now and then when you want something a bit light.  Easy to follow the plot without paying close attention.  Probably okay for the kids too, except for the shootings, although they see plenty of that on TV anyway, so nothing new here.  Probably would be a PG rating if it was rated today.",[],B000QCU9IU,B000QCU9IU,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1193698638000,1,False
4.0,MISLEADING TITLE?,"Wasn't quite sure what the title of this movie was meant to convey.  Perhaps that the characters were ghostlike?  From the title, I expected a very different movie than what actually unfolded.  There are no supernatural beings (ghosts) portrayed in this movie.  Having lived in both Vietnam and Thailand for a number of months, I presume Cambodia is similar in look and feel.  This movie really captures the feel of the region.  I don't think I have seen a movie capture the flavor of a place as well as this one; not even documentaries.  This couldn't have been made on a movie set; they must have done it mostly in Thailand.  I wonder if they actually did go to Cambodia for some of the filming?  The characters are believable too.  What would have made this a near perfect movie would have been a better plot.  The plot was a little difficult to follow and seemed a little thin at times.  I never did quite figure out what exactly was going on, but given that the story was about con men, perhaps that was part of the point?  Not an easy movie to watch because it is hard to pick a hero to identify with, as almost everyone is either a con or just trying to survive in a harsh environment.  This movie is a little different than most of the standard action/adventure movies we see.  It lumbers along, never really picking up any momentum.  On the other hand, it never gets boring; the pace keeps up just enough to keep you interested.  It would be hard to doze off during this movie, but you aren't going to be on the edge of your seat either.  It is a movie that is merely quite good but with a little effort could have been wonderful.<br />I think it is worth watching just because it is a little different and doesn't follow a standard formula.  You might be left feeling a little unsettled or unsatisfied when the movie is done, but you probably will not be indifferent.",[],B0000AZKP8,B0000AZKP8,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1192873828000,2,False
4.0,Not Very Historically Accurate,"I am committing a sin here by reviewing a version that I haven't seen, but I wanted to make a comment or two about the movie itself for the one or two people who might never have seen it.  It's hard to find fault with this movie; it's wonderful family entertainment and the music is unforgettable.  That's part of the problem; the music has been played so much that you might be sick and tired of the songs.  The one I never tire of is ""Climb Every Mountain"".  The biggest problem with the movie is that it isn't very accurate.  We all know that Hollywood takes liberties with the truth, sometimes to make a movie more interesting than what the truth might be.  What I don't understand is why they do it when the truth itself is probably just as interesting or even more interesting.  A couple of notable examples; the names of all the children were changed in the movie.  Why not keep the original names?  Secondly, contrary to the movie where the father was so opposed to his children singing in public, he actually encouraged it because they needed to sing to help support the family that had gotten into dire financial circumstances.  The movie makes it seem like they were wealthy all the way through until leaving Austria.  It seems to me that the TRUE story would have been more interesting than this highly fictionalized account.  I hope they remake this one day with a little more attention to facts.  And following up with how they succeeded in America and what they did would be a wonderful sequel.  This movie has been shown so many times on television and I have seen so often that I am sick of it.  My wife loves the movie and can watch it anytime.  It is on at least once a year, so why buy a copy?  It's a movie that won't go away any time soon.  A classic love story based on true events.  Just be warned that it takes a lot of liberties with the facts.  I am surprised that the real Maria Von Trapp gave this movie such a favorable nod.  The then fresh-faced Julie Andrews was certainly more attractive than the somewhat homely real Maria.",[],B000AP04OM,B000AP04OM,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1192259792000,1,False
4.0,Full of Suspense,"I don't really care much for Jodie Foster, but the premise of this movie was interesting (a child comes up missing on a flight after boarding with her mother).  No one remembers seeing the child, so is the child really somewhere aboard the plane or is the mother crazy with grief from her husband's death?  Did the child perhaps die as well and she couldn't deal with both being dead, so in her mind she still sees the child?  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.  Some reviewers said they guessed the surprise ending early on.  Maybe I don't watch enough movies because I did NOT guess it, until it was revealed.  Yes, there are some real problems with the plot, but I didn't notice it until others pointed it out.  The one thing that really bothered me was how could the highjackers be sure that the mother would open the coffin of her dead husband during the flight, so they could get their explosives hidden in the coffin?  That was a real long shot and depended on some very specific things happening that couldn't be controlled.  There were some other holes, but in the long run you are able to forgive a lot just because the movie stays interesting.  I wouldn't consider this a great performance by Foster, but it was passable.  My four star rating might be stretching things a little; maybe more like a 3 or 3 1/2 star movie.",[],B000BYY11Y,B000BYY11Y,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1190028487000,2,False
2.0,Trashy and Stupid,"This was a strange movie with not many funny scenes.  They tried a little too hard to make it funny but it just falls flat.  In many ways this is a vulgar movie.  Showing guys jerking off through their hotel windows is not funny, even though I think they meant it to be.  Also what could have been a very funny sequence involving a beached whale seemed to focus a little too much on breasts of a couple of the girls on the nude beach or more correctly the topless beach.  There were some semi-porn scenes in the motel.  If you want to make a porn movie, make a porn movie.  If you want to make a comedy, make a comedy.  This appeared to try and mix the two and didn't succeed at either.  This could have been so much more.  It's mildy entertaining and it has its moments, but mostly it's not worth your time.  NOT FOR TEENS and definately not for younger kids.",[],B000PISZ8Q,B000PISZ8Q,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1189381008000,3,False
4.0,Interesting Portrait of Howard Hughes,"This portrait of Hughes shows him both as a forward looking genius who took tremendous chances that ended in great success and as a reclusive eccentric with mental problems.  Is it accurate?  I don't know.  I have two problems with this movie.  First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio was not convincing as Howard Hughes.  He tried very hard, but it just doesn't quite succeed.  I think he is still too young and inexperienced to really pull it off.  It's not a terrible job of acting, but nothing spectacular either.  Perhaps a very difficult role to do.  The second problem was the ending.  The movie just stopped without any real conclusion.  I guess after almost 3 hours, they had to end it at some point.  I was disappointed that they didn't follow the story on a little further and make it more of a full biography.  It would have been too long then, but some scenes could have been cut and the movie could have completed Hughes life within 3 hours.  If nothing else, the movie inspired me to want to read more about Hughes and find out how many liberties they took in the film.  Did Hughes really drink only milk from a sealed bottle?  Was he a cleanliness freak?  Did his mental illness cause him to repeat something over and over again?  How much that went on between TWA and Pan Am in the movie actually occurred?  Was Hughes a big ladies man and did he and Kate Hepburn have a relationship for quite some time, as the movies suggests?  The movie held my interest from start to finish, so for that I give it 4 stars.  Is it really a 4-star movie?  Perhaps not, but it was very entertaining and that's what movies are supposed to do--entertain you.  Hughes was such an interesting man, a true documentary biography might have been actually more far more enjoyable than this fictionalized account.",[],B00080ZG10,B00080ZG10,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1187992806000,1,False
5.0,Never a Dull Moment,"Before I looked at the lowest ratings, I knew that most of those rating it that way would say this movie was boring.  Why?  Because it is not a fast-paced, in-your-face, thrill-a-minute movie.  But I didn't find it slow or boring.  I thought it was an absolutely fascinating look behind the scenes of how the royals think and act.  Was it accurate?  Who knows, since they live in such a private, sheltered world?  But it certainly was convincing.  The Oscar for Helen Mirren's performance was well deserved, but all the characters were convincing.  Very well cast movie.  I have watched it twice all the way through and two more times partially.  No, there is nothing complex here and no great plot.  Just a really good depiction of how events may have unfolded.  After a while you forget you are watching a movie and it almost seems like a behind the scenes peek at the monarchy.  The actors and actresses are that good.",[],B00005JPAO,B00005JPAO,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1185572781000,2,False
5.0,Brilliant Performance by Chris Cooper,"I so much enjoyed Chris Cooper's performance in Seabiscuit as Tom Smith, the horse's trainer that I was anxious to see him in this movie to see if he was really as good as he seemed to be in that movie.  He was.  In fact he was better.  This is a masterful, oscar-winning performance.  For those who complained about this not being an action-packed spy thriller, all I can say is grow up.  Sure it's a let down when you go into a movie expecting one thing and getting something else.  On the other hand, this is a better movie than some of the ""standard"" Hollywood fare of fast-paced action movies with lots of explosions and car crashes.  Don't we have enough of those kind of movies?  Watch Die Hard if you want that, which I enjoyed too.  This is based on true events and the people in the movie were real people.  Several reviewers doubted the young agent ever existed; he did.  He may not have had much of a role in bringing Hanssen down as the movie shows, but the movie did strive to be as accurate as possible, even down to recreating the actual office where Hanssen worked.  I don't give many movies 5 stars, but this one is a winner.",[],B000OYAT3U,B000OYAT3U,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1184414680000,3,False

The kids probably won't like it.  I don't know what audience they were aiming for, but this movie fails for any audience.  I didn't think the animation was all that wonderful when compared to many other current animated films.<br />Skip this one and get: ""Ice Age, The Meltdown"" instead.

5.0,Funny and Touching from Start to Finish,"Animated features seem to get better and better through the years, but even the best ones always seem to be less than desirable for the adult audience.  Not this movie.  This is one of the funniest animated films I have ever seen.  Also, you forget that you are watching a ""glorified"" cartoon and you really start liking the characters.  They certainly went all out in this film and it's really a hoot from beginning to end.  The movie has everything; comedy, drama, romance and even music.  I enjoyed it totally all the way through and you will too.  Could of sworn that I heard a couple of swear words though, but probably nothing the kids haven't already heard.  Both younger and older kids will love the movie.  This is one of the best movies made that all ages will enjoy.  Even grandma and grandpa will probably find it a ""hoot"".  If you are only going to see one animated feature this year, make it this one.

5.0,Not a Perfect Movie But Still Rates 5 Stars,"The chemistry between Will Smith and his real son who stars in this makes this movie very special.  I don't think another child actor could have pulled it off as well.  Most of the movie is factual, but the age of the child was 2 and not 5 as in the movie.  Also I find it hard to believe that he would have twice lost the scanning machines he was trying to sell and then able to recover them both times (or was it 3 times)?  Several reviewers complained that the movie did not show much of the happy part of his life, but it wasn't necessary because you know that once he lands the job at Dean Whitter that he will be just fine, especially knowing the sacrifices that he went through to get it.  Some say this is Will Smith's best performance yet and it may well be.  He was very convincing in the role and nothing was over done or under done.  His kid was cute without being precocious or too smart.  The relationship between father and son couldn't have been done any better.  This is not a movie about overcoming racism, but in Chris Gardner's own words, it's about overcoming ""Placeism"".  By that he means being born in a poor family without influence or advantage and no money of his own and having to overcome those disadvantages.  The real Chris Gardner is a great role model for those who think they can't make it in this world because of who they are, the color of their skin, what they do or don't start with or where they come from.  One of the best lines in the movie is when Chris (Smith) tells his son: ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something--not even me"".  The bonus features are nice, especially learning about the Italian director who could barely speak English and getting to see and hear the real Chris Gardner.  The movie is a little long and even though you know that he gets the job in the end, it is still an emotional scene and one of the best in the movie when he finally gets told.",[],B000N6U0E2,B000N6U0E2,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1175746416000,1,False
3.0,Aggressive Snakes and Gore,"I kind of enjoyed this movie, but it was very predictable.  It was far fetched.  The snakes looked rather fake and seemed more aggressive than one would ever believe, even hyped up with pheromones sprayed on flowers in the plane to excite the snakes.  I noticed one kid's review, but I wouldn't take any kids to see this movie.  Not only are there some very gory scenes; there is also a semi-nude scene.  Shortly into the movie a guy is clubbed to death with a baseball bat and while you don't see it happen, you do see the splatter of blood coming out and all over the assailant.  Some kids are fascinated with snakes and probably wanted to see this movie, but it is not appropriate for children in any way.  Samuel Jackson is his usual charming self and was fun to watch.  Too many things here don't add up in this movie and it really takes a stretch of imagination to believe it.  The movie is so far out it is almost laughable.  I can't quite figure out who this movie was made for.  They could have done a much better job on the movie, but went too much overboard on many things.  Stuff just doesn't happen this way.  Hard to say why I enjoyed it somewhat.  I wouldn't know who to recommend this movie to.  It will probably quickly fade away as it has very little to redeem it.",[],B000JBXHQY,B000JBXHQY,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1174280039000,1,False

Just a bunch of vulgar-mouthed teens thrashing around in the woods after dark and never really finding much of anything.  The most boring movie I ever watched.  It could have been so much more.  Might have been a good 1/2 hour Twilight Zone episode, but Rod Serling would have done a much better job in a half hour than this did in a full length movie.

2.0,Boooooring,"It amazes me how many people think this movie is wonderful and deserves 4 or 5 stars.  It is very boring.  I never really got the point of the movie.  I couldn't see what it was trying to achieve.  Watching the feast being prepared and served was interesting.  It was also amusing seeing the positive changes in the supposedly pious people after they were given multiple glasses of wine and delicious gourmet food.  Prior to the meal they were bickering and arguing; after the meal was well in progress they all turned into much sweeter people and left at the end of the meal in much more pleasant moods.  The point was what?  Give people good wine and good food and they act better than they do otherwise?  As far as the two women giving up love in their lives to remain in a small town serving God and their father, the question is why?  It isn't answered in the film; at least not to my satisfaction.  And why the devotion of Babette to them; again there doesn't seem to be much of an answer provided.  There seemed to be no conflict in their hearts either; just blind devotion to God.  That's a wonderful thing, but it doesn't make an interesting movie.

5.0,Justice After All These Years,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, as it has just about everything in it to tug at your heart strings.  A very serious movie, which also has a few great humorous moments too.  The casting is just about perfect.  Every character was very believable.  Whoopi Goldberg wouldn't have been my choice to play Merlie Evers, but she did a pretty decent job in the role.  I think the movie might have been better with an unknown in the part.  Still, I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Whoopi did.  This is an important movie that helps keep alive the memory of the all but forgotten Medger Evers.  I have watched this movie 3 or 4 times and I never get tired of it.  James Woods is absolutely superb as the militant racist.  Alec Baldwin does a great job.  All the supporting actors and actresses are believable and do a great job as well.  Racists probably won't like this movie, but those of us who have a sense of justice will cheer the fact that a murder conviction against a white man for murdering a black man finally occurred after what was way too long a time.  Justice sometimes takes a while.  Based on true events, which makes it even more compelling.  The movie sustains a continued level of suspense throughout and keeps you interested all the way through.  This movie is also more suitable for a younger audience than two other very good movies with similar themes, A Time to Die and Mississippi Burning, which are more graphic and perhaps more troubling to younger audiences.",[],B00002ND76,B00002ND76,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1171605749000,4,False
3.0,Disappointing,"I love dogs and I really wanted to love this film.  Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as satisfying at most of the reviewers.  Can't quite put my finger on it, but perhaps I didn't find the characters as likeable or convincing as some who saw this.  Even the dog was not that interesting for some reason; perhaps not one of the more attractive breeds.  Also it seemed that they didn't spend enough time developing the bond between the boy and the dog. (The movie is short; not even 1 1/2 hours.) It's a great family movie and I think it is more suitable for young children than older ones who may find it boring.  The younger ones might be a little upset near the end when the dog can't be rescued, but don't worry as it has a happy ending.  It's an okay movie, but I expected a lot more.  I like movies that BOTH kids and adults can enjoy (like Shrek II).  This is definately one mainly just for the kids.  So many things that kids can't or shouldn't watch.  This is one that anyone can watch, which is a big plus.  Probably would have been better as a TV movie and would easily fit in a 2-hour timeframe with plenty of time for commercials.",[],B00007JMDX,B00007JMDX,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1168581546000,3,False
4.0,Complex Plot Keeps You Interested,"You don't want the kids to see this movie.  It is very violent with a lot of killings.  (Also a couple of short nude scenes.)  The movie starts with a brutal killing with a big splatter of blood and guts on a car window.  The movie makes no sense at all in the first few minutes, but as it proceeds all the loose ends are eventually tied up and it all makes perfect sense by the end.  The ending (which I won't reveal) is somewhat a surprise, although you can kind of figure it out somewhat before it is fully revealed and perhaps early on.  I don't usually like this type of movie, but it was interesting enough to keep me watching to see how the hero was going to get out of the serious predicament that he was in.  The top cast keeps it interesting too, but probably not the best performances for any of them.  Lucy Liu seemed a bit weak in her role and too predictably ends up in bed with the hero, but her performance is okay.  A great rental for adults.  Would you want to own it?  Perhaps not because once the surprise ending is revealed it probably is not as interesting to watch again.",[],B000FKO5QK,B000FKO5QK,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1168580530000,5,False

Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away, but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well.  The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles.  Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much, but she sure is easy on the eyes.  She's okay, but they could have done a bit more with her character.  It's not a 5-star movie, but there was never a boring moment for me.  Do you want to own it?; perhaps not.

5.0,A Masterpiece,"This is an absolutely stunning movie.  It is gorgeously photographed which helps to offset the somewhat somber nature of the story.  Have a box of Kleenix handy as this is an emotionally powerful movie.  Those fundamentalists who threatened the life of the director and destroyed the sets and ultimately forced the movie out of India should be ashamed of themselves.  I suppose they were upset because the movie exposed the harsh truth of how widows were treated in India (and perhaps some who still are treated this way).  Sometimes the truth hurts and I think those who protested and fought against this movie do not truly believe that their treatment of widows is right and proper.  If they did honestly believe it, they would have no problem at all with the movie which portrays it as it was (and perhaps still is, in some cases).  They would have no shame if they truly believed they were right and just.  Obviously they don't believe it is right, so it is something that must be hidden; a deep dark secret that makes them look bad.  The interesting thing is that their protests probably made this movie better known than it would have been otherwise.  Instead of keeping it from being made, they strengthened the resolve of the director to make this movie, as well as bringing more attention to it.  I honestly don't think this movie is in any way detrimental to the religion or to the perception that people have of India.  Would anyone get upset if a movie was made about the injustices that America perpetrated on black slaves or native Americans in our past (and sometimes even now)? That's doubtful. How is this any different?; it is set in the 30's, after all.  Things have changed a lot since then in India, as they have in America and many countries.  It's pathetic the way women are treated in some parts of the world.  In many ways, India has changed for the better and is continuing to change, but there are still places in India where (sadly) it is hell to be a woman.",[],B000E112BG,B000E112BG,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1158731892000,6,False
5.0,Best Bruce Dern Movie Ever Made,"Bruce Dern was often cast as a bad guy; after all he was the guy who killed John Wayne (in the Cowboys, I believe).  In this movie he takes on a completely different role, which really showcases his talent and makes you realize that the man is not just great at bad-guy roles, but is an outstanding actor.  This a wonderful satire on the shallowness of beauty pageants and what they are REALLY all about.  It is also very entertaining throughout; much more so than a real beauty pageant!  The casting is absolutely outstanding with all the characters being so believable.  Nice music too with Nat King Cole singing the title song.  The movie has everything including a nice dose of comedy, plenty of drama and a message.  It's as near perfect as a movie can be.  Not disappointing on any level.  Entertaining throughout without being a piece of fluff that so many movies are.  Some nudity, so be warned about that, but it is essential to the plot, unlike some movies where it is unnecessary.

Rather it's a movie with a message--that we need to protect at all costs the things that are really important (the last existing forests in the world in this case).  Other than another little known Bruce Dern movie (Smile), I think this is  his best performance.  Frankly I cringe when I see or hear Bruce Dern, so I think it says a lot for his ability as an actor to pull this off successfully.  I really don't like him, but this is still a favorite movie of mine.  You can't hate the character he plays in this movie because he is doing something terribly important (saving the last forests), but you don't like him either because he is fanatic and ends up killing to save the forests.  I thought the music was great in this movie; very beautiful and haunting.  Some didn't like it because of Joan Baez.  I never liked her politics, but her voice is one of the most beautiful voices of that era.  If I was stranded on a desert island with only one movie to watch, I sincerely hope that it would be this one.  It is not that entertaining to younger folks raised on the computer-generated special effects found in the better science fiction movies.  It will never measure up to something like the Matrix or any of the Star Wars movies, but it is still a hauntingly beautiful movie with special effects that are good enough to keep you interested.  As most other reviewers have said the robots are charming.  Don't listen to the bad reviews; decide for yourself.  Even if you don't like the movie overall, you'll find something enjoyable here.  The somewhat surprise ending is very sad, so if you want an upbeat movie, this is not the one for you, but it couldn't end any other way, really.  This one gives me a tear in the eye and lump in the throat at the end every time I see it.  A little campy and silly, but overall a real gem of a movie.  Probably had more impact and was more impressive at the time it first came out, than now.",[],B000063UR1,B000063UR1,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1131757354000,12,False
1.0,This is not the next Lord of the Rings,"This is nothing like Lord of the Rings. Even the best CGI can't save awful content. Most of it skirts the line between outright boring or vaguely uncomfortable to positively disgusting and gruesome. The violence is edgy and feels unnecessary. What little of the dialogue might otherwise have been inspiring is drowned out by sex and the same rubbish that pervades nearly every show these days.<br /><br />I have not read the books, but to whatever extent this series showcases what was in the books, it leaves me disinterested from reading them to that same degree.<br /><br />The actors for their part tried, and they obviously found talented ones, but this isn't going to be the show that gets them the recognition they deserve.<br /><br />This reeks of the same malady that GoT must have - another show I avoid for exactly the same reasons as I will now be avoiding this one. One gets the sense that political correctness carries a far greater weight in the writers/directors minds than understanding what an audience might want from it or find enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />If the novels had anything worthwhile or substantive in them it's safe to say this show has basically squashed it.",[],B09F5KBXB6,B09F5KBXB6,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1662333688106,8,False
2.0,Hateful and violent without much purpose,"After hearing rave reviews of Keanu Reeves' redeeming performance (and that they are now making another Matrix sequel, apparently), I had to give this series a try.<br /><br />Reeves definitely delivers as an actor, but that's the only compliment I can pay this movie. It's just a string of hate-filled violence with no real sense of direction or resolution. Compare it to the Bourne movies where you feel a real tie to Bourne and his survival instinct and goal of finding himself and regaining his identity and freedom. Here, a man takes some revenge on a lot of people, and though he's really good at it, the motive just doesn't catch the attention. Even Taken, which was also pretty violent, does a better job with the emotional tie-in than this movie.<br /><br />I would say don't bother. Who wants to watch mindless violence? If you want to see a decent Keanu Reeves movie, there are other options, few though they may be.",[],B00R8Q0TVE,B00R8Q0TVE,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1576437801025,0,True
5.0,Really makes you think,"This is one of my absolute favorite movies. If you like movies that ask hard questions and leave you without easy answers, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />It explores the concept of linguistic relativity - the idea that the languages we speak affect how we think - to its most ultimate, extreme, and astonishing conclusion. That may prove too much for some, and a thrilling ride for others.<br /><br />I will only leave one non-spoiler hint to whet your appetite: the title doesn't mean what you think it does. As one other reviewer put it, the ending of this movie is haunting, but not because aliens are involved.",[],B01M2C4NP8,B01M2C4NP8,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1576437252434,0,False
5.0,The line between Cruise and Hunt continues to blur,"This is the best Mission: Impossible yet. Like any other movie, it's not without its flaws, but chances are you're not watching a seemingly-impossible mission being pulled off to hunt for moviemaking flaws but rather to be entertained. This is the most gripping, thrilling, MI movie in the entire series, and that's saying something. Apparently, there are two more planned, but I have no clue how they could possibly top this installment.<br /><br />Since watching the cliff scene at the beginning of MI:2 and learning that Cruise apparently did it with no safety net (at his own insistence, and I imagine, the chagrin of his agent) I have always been simultaneously impressed and appalled at how far Tom Cruise will go to actually become Ethan Hunt in the movie-making itself. It's as if with every new Mission: Impossible movie he has to prove that he really could be Ethan Hunt in real life - a step beyond normal acting. Cruise's ""meta"" chops are what makes movies like this so immensely gripping as he continues to blur the line between Tom Cruise and Ethan Hunt.<br /><br />I particularly liked the writing in Fallout. It kept the story unpredictable, which at the sixth episode of Mission: Impossible, is actually pretty hard to do. My only disappointment was what they did with CIA director Hunley's character.<br /><br />I agree with other commenters that it's not Henry Cavill's best performance. I liked him a lot more in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. or Man of Steel. However, seeing as he was just a bonus character to begin with, it didn't really bother me.",[],B07FSQDJKG,B07FSQDJKG,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1566706897089,0,False
5.0,The most inspiring show on TV,"This show is so uplifting and inspiring compared to all the other garbage that is on TV these days.<br /><br />Even compared to other competition-type shows, it stands out head and shoulders above the rest. Rather than contestants being pitted against each other in a ""you versus me"" or ""me versus them"" or ""us versus them"" mindset, everyone roots for everyone else! Where else do you see a show like that? In most episodes, I generally end up in tears by the end because of one or more of the inspiring stories.<br /><br />The hosts are very good at their jobs. I love it when Matt Iseman yells ""American Ninja Warrior"" and always leaves you wondering which of the three words he emphasized more (I suspect he practices doing that). The host's jokes and one-liners (about how the electrician got shocked by such and such obstacle) are always on point and never rude or distasteful. I am amazed at how they can keep coming up with those.<br /><br />I recently tried to watch another similar show (won't name names) but the difference was obvious. It just seemed so fake by comparison. The contestants were trying really hard to come up with something interesting to say, but it just fell flat and made ANW seem that much more real and high-quality.<br /><br />My only complaint is the nearest ninja gym is too far away! This show inspires me to train harder and now I want to develop my own ninja skills.",[],B07S9V8KHS,B07S9V8KHS,AGU7O3UW7U2UMZGSZMKNZ6K6VHUA,1566516796069,1,False

5.0,"""Wild horses couldn't drag me back to that accursed place...""","TNT's version of Treasure Island left an indelible mark on my young impressionable mind. I'd already read the novel several times, but seeing Stevenson's novel come to life on the small screen was an incredible journey. This was my first introduction to the Chieftains and Irish music (the majority of the Treasure Island soundtrack can be found on Film Cuts), and soon after, I bought my first tin whistle and learned to play the Treasure Island theme.<br /><br />The stellar cast is headed by Charlton Heston as the roguishly charming Long John Silver and a young Christian Bale fresh off of [[ASIN:B00003CX9U Empire of the Sun (Snap Case Packaging)]]]. Other notables include a cameo by horror master Christopher Lee as Blind Pew, Julian Glover as Dr. Livesey and Pete Postlethwaite as George Merry. The cast is largely composed of classically trained British theater actors and it shows.<br /><br />The film's sense of authenticity is also earned through its period costumes, makeup, and furnishings, elaborate sets and using the actual HMS Bounty rather than a model (I became obsessed with tall ships after seeing this). The film was a combination of soundstage and location footage filmed in England (Cornwall, Buckinghamshire, Devon) and Jamaica that fused seamlessly to transport the viewer from prim and proper English country estates to the sweltering, malaria-infested jungles of Treasure Island.<br /><br />The screenplay stays fairly faithful to the original novel; Long John is played to perfection by Heston, who infuses his role with a charming smile hiding a shark's voracious grin. Silver is not a cutesy one as played by Wallace Beery in Treasure Island; rather, he's as cutthroat as the shifty crew. Bale's Jim goes from a wide-eyed boy who'd never seen the world to one who's forced to come of age quickly and brutally at the hands of Silver and his crew. The screenplay plays up the interactions between Jim, Dr. Livesey, Squire Trelawney, and Captain Smollett (Clive Wood puts in a heroic turn with a fierce, I'm -going-down-with-my-ship-and-pirates-be-damned pride), and Silver and his crew.<br /><br />The pacing keeps things moving along briskly and efficiently, and the film's haunting ending (with a voiceover by Bale) will stay in your mind long after you see this. Of the several versions I've seen of Treasure Island, this was the most authentic and enjoyable, and it's long overdue to make an appearance on DVD. Forget Jack Sparrow; these are real, down-and-dirty swashbucklers. There are no CGI effects; only real tall ships, rusty cutlasses, and the glitter of gold and greed. The haunting score by the Chieftains ([[ASIN:B000008E72 Reel Music Film Scores]]) still haunts my dreams to this day.",[],B0057FGCR8,B0057FGCR8,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1316477035000,5,False
4.0,"Finally, this concert DVD does David justice in the US.","Typically, David Garrett's concert DVDs are only available in the US through PBS pledge drives. The footage is the same as his German concert DVDs, but the American PBS versions are noticeably shorter than their German counterparts, and ""Rock Symphonies"" is no exception. However, this time around Decca has put more thought into the total package. David's first concert DVD seemed rushed into production, lacked any sort of interactive menus, and cut between songs with no warning and frequently no introductions (this was in part due to the fact that most of David's intros are in German for a German audience). On ""Rock Symphonies,"" the root menu is the same as the ""Rock Symphonies"" album cover, except the grey background rotates clockwise, giving the impression of movement. The ""Chapters"" menu features the promo photo of David standing on a rooftop with animated dark clouds sweeping across the sky. The ""Bonus Features"" menu is the close-up of David with eyeliner...gorgeous! There are two bonus tracks, ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Live and Let Die."" These can only be accessed from the ""Bonus Features"" menu and not the full concert, apparently. The ""Behind the Scenes"" feature is the same as the North American EPK for ""Rock Symphonies"" (just shy of 6 minutes).<br /><br />Sound and picture quality are great (according to the back of the case, it's 5.1 Surround Sound and 2.0 Stereo). The biggest improvement over the PBS [[ASIN:B002D19EFG David Garrett: Live In Berlin]] is that the introductions flow smoothly into the songs, rather than cutting from song to song. There were actually more non-album tracks like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Peer Gynt,' ""Child's Anthem"" and ""Adagio in G Minor"" than ""Rock Symphonies"" tracks (""Kashmir,"" ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" ""Walk This Way,"" and ""Asturias""). Minus one star for leaving off David's smokin' cover of Metallica's ""Master of Puppets,"" which was hands-down one of the best covers on [[ASIN:B003O86MY8 Rock Symphonies]]. Australian guitarist Orianthi really rocked out with David on the Michael Jackson medley, which saw David exploring ""Billy Jean"" and ""I'll Be There"" on the heels of last year's cover of ""Smooth Criminal."" It was also nice to see one song (""Zorba's Dance"") carried over from the [[ASIN:B001UW58WW David Garrett]] album of last year. However, compared to the German Open Air Live DVD, there are only thirteen tracks (plus the two bonus tracks accessed separately) clocking in at just shy of an hour. It's too bad that they didn't include the studio interviews with David that were filmed as part of the PBS pledge special as bonus materials, seeing as this is a PBS exclusive.<br /><br />Overall, the PBS ""Rock Symphonies"" DVD feels like Decca took more care with packaging and designing menus (using hi-res promotional photos from ""Rock Symphonies"" and adding animated backgrounds, for example). It's great to hear David add his own unique intros to the songs, like the stories about him being an ersatz drummer at a gig in London, or the story about when he was seventeen and a girl tried to kiss him on the beach. His connection to his fans is obvious...he dedicates one song to a ""couple in love"" in the audience, and he positively glows whenever he performs. If you're looking for the full David concert experience, by all means get one of the German versions: there'a a regular, Region 0 2DVD set, ASIN B003V89YT6 and a Blu-Ray version, ASIN B00415Z9Y2 at Amazon.de.

4.0,A fun entry in the vampire / detective genre...,"Vampires are all the rage on the small screen. Just look at recent entries [[ASIN:B000WFW12S Moonlight - The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]], or the CW's ""The Vampire Diaries.""<br /><br />Blood Ties is a Canadian TV production that was filmed as a 22-episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes (""Blood Price"" to ""Post Partum"") as Season One and the remaining eleven (""Norman"" to ""Deep Dark"") as Season Two. This box set collects all 22 episodes for the first time in North America (the British box set that was released several years ago features all 22 episodes, but no extras). The TV budget doesn't allow top-notch special effects, but the show really works with what it has (the set designs are great, but the CGI is largely lacking), and its strength is in the writing and performances.<br /><br />Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson, an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again, off-again affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.<br /><br />The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's [[ASIN:0756405017 Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)]]. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry (Kyle Schmid beat out RPatz as sexiest vampire in a recent poll). Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.<br /><br />Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama.

4.0,One of the strongest episodes in the series.,"In Episode 14 of the Vampire Diaries, many thematic elements that have been introduced across the season have finally come together. Damon's quest to free his love Katherine, who was locked inside the Mystic Falls church in 1864, comes to an explosive head as Stefan rescues Elena from her vampire kidnappers. Matt and Caroline are still trying to make their fledgling romance work, while Jeremy has fallen for the strange new girl, Anna, who is much more than she appears to be. Even Tyler makes a (not-too-notable) appearance (his first post-hiatus, I think).<br /><br />All of the elements from the last several episodes come together in a satisfying conclusion, including the identity and purpose of the new vampires in town and Damon's quest to obtain Emily Bennett's grimoire in order to break the seal on the tomb. Elena, Stefan and Bonnie have promised to release Katherine, but not the other vampires. Unlike the previous episode, there are no flashbacks in ""Fool Me Once."" Elena must appeal to Damon's attraction to her after she's broken his trust in the last episode; his acquiescence is vital to their scheme. Bonnie's grandmother (Jasmine Guy) also plays a pivotal role in opening the long-sealed tomb.<br /><br />The pacing, plot and performances show just how far this show has come since the pilot. There's a new maturity and depth of emotion to the storyline; several characters lose someone they loved. Ian Somerhalder shines in this episode; Damon is taken from hope to anger to the deepest grief, and we feel along with him every step of the way. There's a palpable sense of tension and foreboding that runs throughout the episode and carries the dramatic moments without resorting to cheap effects or gore. This episode would have made a perfect close to the first season, as it does such a good job of wrapping up many of the loose ends.",[],B00387YA6C,B00387YA6C,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1266196139000,1,False
5.0,A much-needed dialogue on a rich culture,"I've been a fan of Rick Steves for many years (I always use his guidebooks when traveling, download his podcasts and rent his DVDs). I'm also a huge fan of Iran's rich cultural tapestry and have had several Iranian acquaintances over the years. So when I saw on Rick's blog that he was filming a one-hour special on Iran, I rushed over to Hulu to watch it. Rick takes you on a journey from Iran's metropolitan capital Tehran to Abyaneh, Esfahan, Shiraz and Persepolis.<br /><br />The opening shot of Tehran's buildings silhouetted against the smog-shrouded Alborz Mountains is carried by a breathy nay and santur soundtrack. The colors of Tehran's streets are crisp and bright, a stark contrast to the women gliding silently by in black chadors. I loved the portraits of everyday Iranians that showcased the complexity of Iran's cultural heritage: in addition to Persians, there are Greek, Arab, Turkish, Mongol, and Azerbaijani descendents. Rick makes sure to point out that Iranians are NOT Arabs, and they don't speak Arabic. The national language is Farsi (also spoken in neighboring Afghanistan, where it is called Dari). Although Farsi uses a modified Arabic script with several letters not found in Arabic (p, ch, zhe, and g), Farsi is a completely separate language with a rich literary tradition. As Iran is a Muslim country, it also uses two separate calendars: the Hijri calendar, and the Western calendar for business affairs.<br /><br />Rick's objective eye captures the seeming contradictions in modern Iran: enforced modesty for women means that hair must be covered, yet high fashion and plastic surgery are equally visible. He's respectful at religious sites such as the tomb of Ruhollah Khomeini and the mosque at Esfahan, and makes an effort to be a polite guest. Jum'ah prayers were eye-opening: soldiers are both among the worshippers, and standing guard to prevent violence (because this was filmed and produced in 2008, there is no mention of the recent massive protests following the June 2009 elections). Rick also gives a mini-history lesson into Iran's tumultuous modern history, with archival footage of Iran's young oilfields, the last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq. As an American, it was curious to see the Supreme Leader's (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) likeness everywhere rather than the president's. Steves also doesn't shy away from the fading ""Death to America"" murals in front of the American Embassy. The sheer number of these propaganda murals is staggering.  Yet young Iranians (more than half of the country's population of 70 million is under 30) seem generally pleased to make contact and to practice their English, even if some shy away from the camera. The young university students (most of the ones speaking on camera are women) are surprisingly eloquent as they try to express their views on Iran's government and its attitude towards the West.<br /><br />Rick's willingness to understand modern Iran on its own terms is a rewarding journey; smiles are rewarded at every turn, from dusty ancient villages to the modern hustle and bustle of Tehran. We're invited into a middle class family's home for an elaborate dinner. As Steves notes, ""Maybe we're all just struggling to defend the moral fabric of our respective societies. I've been wondering to what extent US-Iran tensions might be explained by caring people on both sides motivated by love and fear. And the flip side of fear is understanding. I came to Iran a little nervous. I leave impressed by more what we have in common than by our differences.""",[],1598803220,1598803220,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1254099684000,21,False
4.0,Bloody good fun,"Alan Ball ([[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]]) takes on Charlaine Harris's beloved [[ASIN:0441017770 Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7]] in True Blood, starring Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse, a telepathic waitress in a small Louisiana parish. Sookie's gift is feared and misunderstood by the superstitious locals, although her boss Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) is sympathetic and longs to woo Sookie. Sookie lives with her grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) and her cat and has no romantic life to speak of; being able to read her dates' thoughts is a real turn-off. Her boring life is turned upside-down by the arrival of Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a vampire who's lived since the Civil War. In Harris's world, vampires have been ""out of the coffin"" for a couple of years and are seeking their civil rights, although Bill is the first vampire that Sookie's seen in Bon Temps.<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Tara (Rutina Wesley), an uppity and downright disagreeable young woman with serious issues, Sookie's himbo brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), who's into kinky sex and lots of it, and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), Tara's super-gay cousin who works as a short-order cook with a side of drug dealing. These three characters are given much larger roles than in the original novel, and this is not always an effective choice. Some of the invented side stories meander and eventually become loose ends that don't add to the storyline.<br /><br />One of the sticking points are the ""Southern"" accents; many of the leads aren't American (Paquin is originally from New Zealand, Kwanten is Aussie and Moyer is English), and the rest of the cast hails from various Southern states (Georgia, Tennessee, West Virginia). Generally, the accents don't noticeably distract (at least not for me, but I grew up in the northern US). Eric Northman is played by Swedish actor Alex Skarsgard ([[ASIN:B001AQO3WY Generation Kill]]), and like in the books, he has a very slight accent that crops up from time to time (Alex also gets to say a few lines in Swedish).<br /><br />Ball and the various writers (including input from Charlaine Harris) use [[ASIN:0441018254 Dead Until Dark: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]] as the basis for the major plot arcs of the first season, which will please fans. Dark humor lightens the tone, but the series is far more blood-drenched and sexed up than the books; nearly every episode features full nudity of Jason in various positions vigorously ""working out."" I could have done without the graphic sex or the constant string of profanity. There's also a lot of gore and violence towards women.  The special effects were generally good, although I disliked the drug trip sequences and thought that it took the series too far from its original destination. The music was spot-on and enhanced scenes with the right tone.<br /><br />The opening credits deserve special mention; the uneasy blend of decomposing animals, maggots, sex and salvation is brilliant. The feel of the series captures a backwoods small town trapped by poverty, steeped in alcohol, and fueled by evangelism. Ball draws several none-too-subtle analogies between vampires coming out and gay bashing; ""God hates fangs"" is a recurring theme, and there's a gay vampire that pleads for understanding. Lafayette's character is also discriminated against by several drunk rednecks who tell him that they don't want his ""AIDS burger."" There are also political statements not present in the original books; the vampire bar Fangtasia has a telling portrait of W. as a vampire greedily draining the neck of the Statue of Liberty, and Terry is an Iraq war vet suffering from PTSD who says that watching politicians on TV ""gives him seizures.""<br /><br />Extras include several tongue-in-cheek (fang in cheek?) parodies of cheesy ads for vampire dating services, True Blood commercials, and short promo pieces that were originally featured as viral videos on the True Blood website, as well as audio commenteries. Overall, True Blood does a good job of capturing the feel of the original novels and should please fans of the series.",[],B001FB4W0W,B001FB4W0W,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1244324035000,1,False
5.0,"Worth the wait, but where are the other 11 episodes?","Blood Ties is a Canadian production that was filmed as a 22-episode season. In the US, Lifetime TV decided to split was was actually one season into two, with the first eleven episodes (""Blood Price"" to ""Post Partum"") as Season One and the remaining eleven (""Norman"" to ""Deep Dark"") as Season Two. Blood Ties fans have waited desperately for any news after Lifetime dropped the show like a hot potato despite intensive fan campaigns including blood drives and donations to charities. Their decision to split the show into two is unfortunate from a DVD standpoint; The British Blood Ties box set features all 22 episodes, but the US release features what is essentially half the (only) season. However, there are some excellent episodes here, such as the two-part Heart of Ice / Heart of Fire and the two-part pilot Blood Price. However, where the British set was devoid of extras, the US version will feature behind-the-scenes materials (and there was rumor of a gag/blooper reel mentioned in an interview). The release for Season Two is tentatively scheduled for September 2009; with the popularity of [[ASIN:B000WFW12S Moonlight - The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]], and [[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], sales should be high.<br /><br />Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson, an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again, off-again affair, and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces, and Henry Fitzroy, her new partner on the case, just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.<br /><br />The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's [[ASIN:0756405017 Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)]]. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons, incubi, reanimated corpses, shapeshifters, mummies, voodoo, ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual, deadly Henry. Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen, who also has her eye on Henry.<br /><br />Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print, but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction, it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread.

4.0,A fabulous swashbuckler from Norway,"Disney's Shipwrecked was released in 1990, the same year that I became intimately acquainted with the TNT production of [[ASIN:B001993YE0 Treasure Island (1990 TVmovie)]] starring Charlton Heston. My then-ten-year-old self became endlessly obsessed with all things pirates, sailing, and tall ships for years to come. Shipwrecked was a Norwegian production based on by Norwegian author O. V. Falck-Ytter's ""Haakon Haakonsen. En norsk Robinson,"" a Norwegian children's novel from 1873 that was a tale of a ""Norwegian Family Robinson."" Directed by Nils Gaup and starring almost entirely Norwegian actors, it was filmed on location in Norway, Spain, the UK and Fiji.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the titular Haakon Haakonsen (Stian Smestad), a young boy in 1850s Norway who is forced to go to sea as a cabin boy when his father is injured on a sea voyage. His father's friend Jens (Trond Peter Stamsø Munch) agrees to look out for him on board the Flora. Haakon goes through some inevitable growing pains as a boy onboard a ship for the first time; some of the seasoned sailors have fun playing pranks on him at first, but Haakon is watched over by Jens and the kindly captain. After a shore leave in Sydney, Haakon discovers a stowaway on board; Mary (Louisa Millwood-Haigh), an orphan trying to reach her uncle in Calcutta). But the voyage meets an abrupt end when a suspicious Royal Navy officer (Gabriel Byrne) takes control of the ship and the crew is shipwrecked in the tropics.<br /><br />The movie moves along quite well until the ending, which is a tad disappointing in tone after the great setup (it borders on unintentionally comic; for a really great pirate chase, check out the end of Fraser Heston's 1990 made-for-TV Treasure Island for TNT; now there's a scurvy lot to give you nightmares!) Beautifully shot and with a memorable score by Patrick Doyle, Shipwrecked is a family-friendly tale of loyalty, discovery, and adventure on the high seas. It's short on special effects and low on violence or profanity; instead, it's built on solid characters and a well-crafted plot.<br /><br />All of the Norwegian actors are strong, particularly the two leads, and Louisa turns in a spirited performance as a feisty orphan. Gabriel Byrne puts in a deliciously wicked turn as the villain; you can just sense the danger that lurks under the surface when he snarls out threats (if you enjoyed Byrne in Shipwrecked, check out his captivating performance of a loving father struggling with grief and alcoholism in Disney's magical [[ASIN:B00007K02D Into the West]]). The Norwegian actors have slight accents, but nothing that should interfere with understanding the dialogue.<br /><br />Shipwrecked made quite an impression on me, and I'm grateful that it's finally available on DVD as of fall 2008 (it was previously only available as a Club Disney selection). Those who enjoyed [[ASIN:B00005RRG7 Swiss Family Robinson (Vault Disney Collection)]], Robinson Crusoe, and Treasure Island should find much to like in Shipwrecked. Sadly, the DVD doesn't come with *any* extras save subtitles, but it's a worthy addition to any family's DVD collection.",[],B001B73Q2K,B001B73Q2K,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1232501968000,3,False
4.0,A darker season heralds a plunge into madness,"Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman return in the second season of the fantasy series Beauty and the Beast. Season Two features grittier storylines that probe the worst that humanity has to offer, including street gangs, drug addicts, gruesome murders, and the sick revenge of a twisted mind that threatens to shatter Vincent's sanity. There were several episodes that I really enjoyed, such as ""God Bless the Child,"" where a frightened teenage prostitute seeks sanctuary for her unborn child and falls in love with Vincent, ""A Fair and Perfect Knight,"" where Michael, a very bright young tunnel dweller, falls in love with Catherine before starting college Above, ""Brothers,"" featuring the return of Vincent's brother Devin, a master at reinventing himself, and ""Remember Love,"" a Capra-esque look at what life would have been like if Vincent hadn't met Catherine. Several characters from the first season return, including Mouse, Laura, Elliott Burch, and Paracelsus.<br /><br />The main story arc of season two revolves around outcast mad genius John Pater, aka Paracelsus (Tony Jay). After being expelled from the tunnels and nearly killed in a fire in the last season, Paracelsus plots his ghastly revenge against Father and Vincent, first in the episode ""Dead of Winter"" and in the final season-end trilogy ""What Rough Beast,"" ""Ceremony of Innocense,"" and ""The Rest is Silence."" The dark, gory storyline in the final three episodes sets up a cliffhanger for the final season, which in turn was even darker and more violent than the second. I really disliked the direction that the show was taking at the end of season two; this subject had already been covered in season one's ""The Alchemist"" and I would have preferred to see a stronger focus on Catherine and Vincent's relationship. The writers essentially ruined their special relationship by placing Vincent in increasingly more violent situations that shred the delicate balance between man and beast.<br /><br />But there are several bright spots: the writing feels more consistent, there is more physical contact and less awkwardness between Catherine and Vincent, and there are several good episodes here, such as ""When the Bluebird Sings,"" which stars the (possible) ghost of a playful painter, and ""A Distant Shore,"" in which Vincent is largely absent, but there is some gorgeous dream scenery of Catherine and Vincent walking together in the rolling surf. Ron Perlman emotes extraordinarily well even under Rick Baker's superb makeup and bulky clothes; in the later episodes, his eyes capture the madness and torture inside of Vincent. Set design is gorgeous as usual, calling to mind Brian Froud's work on [[ASIN:B000R8YC1I The Dark Crystal (25th Anniversary Edition)]]. Extras are scarce, but there are several new introductions by Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman on select episodes. The packaging is great: it's easy to access each DVD, and they're separated so they don't get scratched.  This is a wise investment for fans of season one, but if you're new to the series, start with [[ASIN:B000K7UBX4 Beauty and the Beast - The Complete First Season]]. If you're a diehard fan, you're probably better off buying [[ASIN:B001AZIRZO Beauty and the Beast - The Complete Series]]. As for myself, I was so disappointed in the direction that the series was going that I didn't bother watching the final season, which saw the departure of most of the original cast.",[],B000OONQ9Y,B000OONQ9Y,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1232313067000,3,False
4.0,Seeing is believing,"""At First Sight"" is based on the true story of a man who was blind for nearly his entire life due to cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa before having his sight temporarily restored. Based on an essay by British neurologist Oliver Sacks (who also penned Awakenings), the film follows stressed-out New York architect Amy (Mira Sorvino) as she attempts to ""relax"" at a weekend spa retreat. At the reception desk, she frowns at the list of activities and settles on daily massages instead. At her first session, she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer), a man with a truly magic touch. To her embarrassment, Amy breaks down crying as someone actually takes the time to touch her for the first time in a long time. Virgil, blind since childhood, excels as a massage therapist and enjoys hockey. Sensitive, constantly smiling and outgoing, he doesn't view blindness as a disability. Amy and Virgil begin seeing each other, but his prickly, overprotective sister Jennie keeps reminding her of Virgil's limitations as a blind man.<br /><br />When Amy returns to New York and finds a doctor that is a pioneer in restoring vision, she urges Virgil to consider having the operation. This is the start of a very honest and painful dialog between Virgil, Jennie, and Amy; as a child, Virgil was subjected to every manner of faith healing in an attempt to cure his blindness. The remainder of the film deals with the aftermath of the surgery and the strain that Virgil's newfound sight places on his and Amy's relationship. After being blind for decades, Virgil's brain is unable to cope with the new flood of visual input, and he is only able to ""see"" by touch for the first few days. It's a refreshing twist on Hollywood portrayals of narrators succumbing to blindness and the sentiment of ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Instead, director Irwin Winkler and the gorgeous cinematography by John Seale paint Virgil's world of darkness in terms of touch, sound (the gorgeous rainstorm that allows Virgil to ""see"" Amy puts [[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]]'s CGI rain effect to shame!!) and smell (Virgil initially describes Amy as smelling like cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, to which his sister says it sounds like he's describing a coffeecake). His post-op world is one of blurry, super-saturated colors, sudden movements, and confusion, and similar to Asperger's Syndrome, Virgil has to learn to ""read"" facial expressions and visual cues.<br /><br />Winkler deftly balances the romantic story with the medical one, although the film feels a touch long and could have benefitted from some editing (I wasn't crazy about Nathan Lane's cameo, although I love him in other films such as [[ASIN:0792833198 The Birdcage]] ). Kilmer handles pre- and post-op Val with tenderness and insight; as a blind man, he relies on his other senses like touch and hearing to guide him, but sight proves more treacherous and difficult than living in a familiar world of darkness. Sorvino's Amy was sweet and supportive, although at times she has difficulty understanding why Virgil would choose his old life over his new one.  The beautiful visual metaphors and the love theme ""Love Is Where You Are"" by Diana Krall only add to the tender appeal of ""At First Sight.""",[],B00000IBL0,B00000IBL0,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1228274704000,1,False
4.0,Love on the high seas,"Leo McCarey's 1957 remake of his 1939 [[ASIN:6305052131 Love Affair]] stars Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr as two completely different people who end up falling in love on a transatlantic cruise. Nickie Ferrante (Grant) is a smooth-talking playboy who has a new girl every night, but his free reign as a bachelor is coming to an end as he's about to marry millionaire Lois Clark. Terry McKay is a nightclub singer in Boston and is in a long-term relationship. Nickie pursues Terry, who at first refuses, but the two fall deeply in love aboard the SS Constitution and try to hide their blossoming romance from curious onlookers and the ship's photographer. Nickie takes Terry to meet his octogenarian grandmother during a shore leave, and Terry is deeply attracted to the peaceful haven overlooking the Mediterranean.<br /><br />When they arrive in New York, they agree that they'll meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building; this will give Nickie time to save up money for a wedding, and for Terry to break the news to her fiancé. But on their six-month anniversary, fate intervenes and all does not go as planned.<br /><br />An Affair to Remember is practically a carbon copy of Love Affair, with the addition of Technicolor and the theme song sung by Vic Damone. Grant and Kerr have a crackling energy and sparkling repartee that make them a joy to root for (both actors did their share of ad libbing). Some of the scenes, particularly those of Terry teaching a children's choir, felt like unabashed filler (and some modern viewers find the tap dance scene by the only two African-American kids in the choir to be racially offensive). Bonus features include an audio commentary by film critic Joseph McBride and Marni Nixon, the singing voice of Terry McKay, profiles of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, bios of director McCarey and producer Jerry Wald, a featurette on the look of An Affair to Remember, and a 25-minute AMC backstory of the filming. There's also a poster and stills gallery to peruse. Overall, this is a cute romance, not the best film you'll ever see but one that's had an impact on popular culture for decades, including [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle (10th Anniversary Edition)]] and the remake [[ASIN:B00005RRJZ Love Affair]].",[],B000WTVZHQ,B000WTVZHQ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1226884353000,0,False
4.0,"Believe in yourself, not your appearance","Penelope is a modern-day fairytale involving a family curse: as revenge for an unjust death, a witch curses the Wilherns so that their first daughter will be born with the face of a pig. For several generations, only males are born, but when Penelope (Christina Ricci) comes along, the curse is fulfilled, and she's born with a pig's snout. Her parents (Catherine O'Hara from Beetlejuice and and Richard E. Grant channeling Christopher Walken) keep her locked away after faking her death so that the paparazzi will steer clear.<br /><br />Now in her mid-twenties, the sheltered Penelope has several talents, including botany, chess, and music (and Penelope's vintage glam costumes are to die for). She's a voracious reader as well, with a library full of rare, valuable first editions. Every week, her overbearing mother makes her meet several potential suitors (bluebloods) in an attempt to break the curse: in order for that to happen, Penelope must be loved by ""one of her own kind."" Most jump out the second-story window in horror when they see Penelope face-to-face, describing her as a gruesome monster (in all fairness, the pig makeup is underwhelming; I saw her face and went, ""that's it?!?""). The butler's job is to catch the escaping suitors to prevent them from blabbing to the press, but one particularly loathsome character, Edward Vanderman the Third (Simon Woods), escapes and sensationalizes Penelope into a drooling, savage monster with razor-sharp fangs; the story is printed on the front page of local newspapers, complete with caricature straight out of the Exorcist.<br /><br />At the same time, down-and-out gambler Max (James McAvoy, [[ASIN:B00005JNV9 Rory O'Shea Was Here]], [[ASIN:B000ZIZ0RA Becoming Jane]] and [[ASIN:B000NIVJF4 The Last King of Scotland (Widescreen Edition)]]) accepts $5,000 for secretly snapping photos of Penelope, and pretends to be genuinely interested in her brains, not her looks. Predictably, the two feel a genuine attraction before long, but Max's secret as a spy is discovered, and he's banished from the house. The rest of the film focuses on Penelope's escape and quest for independence.<br /><br />Quirky, with loveable characters and some not-so-loveable ones rounding out the cast, Penelope feels like a lost Tim Burton film; the zany dialogue reminded me of Beetlejuice at points, as did the dark, twisted visuals. The message of ""love who you are, not what you look like"" is beat over your head about a million times, and Catherine O'Hara as the stage mom is particularly loathsome as she obsesses over plastic surgery for Penelope and other ways to make her daughter ""normal."" But I found Penelope to be an engaging fairytale, if a little long, in large part due to the sparkling performances of Ricci and McAvoy.<br /><br />On a final note, it appears that Penelope has been edited from the theatrical version, with several scenes shortened and some swearing removed. Also, according to posters at IMDB, the music has also been redone. This is a shame, and in large part it's due to some confused marketing; although this would appear to be a children's fairy tale, it's largely adult (Penelope becomes drunk, steals her mother's credit card, etc., there's a blatant sexual reference from Reese Witherspoon's character), and should never have been marketed primarily as addressed towards children. Hopefully, the original theatrical version will be released at some point. Extras include an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Twilight (a new scene, some behind-the-scenes footage, and brief interviews with director Catherine Hardwicke, author Stephenie Meyer, and several of the stars).",[],B0011N1WE8,B0011N1WE8,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1217631162000,4,False
4.0,A romantic world of candlelight and poetry,"This was one of the first ""grownup"" TV shows I remember taking an interest in back when it came out (I was seven). At the time, I was entranced by the visuals, but the more adult elements (romance, intimacy, and urban problems of poverty and discrimination) were lost on me. However, as soon as I heard that Beauty and the Beast had been released to DVD, I rushed out to buy a copy, and the stories and lush visuals don't disappoint.<br /><br />In the TV series, the role of Beauty is Catherine Chandler (Linda Hamilton), a corporate lawyer who is nearly killed in a case of mistaken identity. Brutally beaten and disfigured in a razor attack, she is discovered by the reclusive Vincent (Ron Perlman), part man, part beast who lives in the tunnels below New York City. Vincent and his adopted father (Roy Dotrice) nurse Catherine back to health. Once she returns to the World Above, as Vincent calls it, she is a changed woman and decides to work for the District Attorney's Office in order to help other survivors of violent crimes.  Catherine and Vincent share a strong platonic bond, and although there is definite romantic chemistry between them, they are unable to act on it. Vincent reads Catherine wonderfully romantic, evocative classic love poems; these are also available on the [[ASIN:B000BLI3BG Beauty & the Beast]] CD.<br /><br />First and foremost, the show is carried by Ron Perlman, who makes the lion/man Vincent a deeply sensitive, poetic, and yes, romantic figure aware of his limitations in Catherine's world. Linda Hamilton as Catherine Chandler is beautiful both inside and out;  deeply concerned for the welfare of others, she has chosen her job from altruism, not for money (her father is rich). Catherine becomes familiar with Vincent's world, where those who are different have found a safe haven under Vincent's wing, so to speak, including Mouse (David Greenlee) and Pascal (Armin Shimerman from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine).  Another notable name is Tony Jay as Paracelcus, a villain who threatens Vincent's world below.<br /><br />The 22 first-season episodes range from mediocre (""Masques,"" with some of the worst Irish accents heard on screen), to captivating (""Fever,"" ""An Impossible Silence,"" ""Nor Iron Bars a Cage""). Given, the show's '80s values (especially production values) do date it quite a bit, but the interplay between characters (and the romantic tension between Catherine and her boss Joe) and Vincent's lush, mysterious world of damp tunnels tempered by candlelight carry the viewer's interest.<br /><br />The film's transfer is grainy and blurry, with scratches particularly noticeable on the pilot. The overall video transfer is inconsistent, and that's a shame. Audio quality is decent. The lack of extras is deplorable, particularly given the show's fierce cult following. The packaging is both space-saving and well thought out, although it's hard to read the synopses when the discs are on top of them. Overall, fans of the series will want to snap this up. If you're looking to collect all three seasons, it might be better to hold out for the complete series set [[ASIN:B001AZIRZO Beauty and the Beast: The Complete Series]], which promises new extras.",[],B000K7UBX4,B000K7UBX4,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1214053007000,1,False
4.0,"Funny, gross, and scary at the same time","King Corn is kind of like [[ASIN:B0002OXVBO Super Size Me]]'s little brother. It traces the pervasive influence of corn on modern America, including the obesity epidemic and the fact that Iowa is growing trillions of bushels of *non-edible* corn to continue receiving lucrative government subsidies. College buddies Ian and Curt, both from the east coast, discover that they both had distant relatives from the same small town of Greene, Iowa. Ian and Curt decide to go to Iowa and plant one acre of corn, following it through its lifecycle, including where it goes after the harvest.<br /><br />The film starts off slowly as the reasons for the trip are explained. The prerequisite talking heads introduce some scary factoids about how Americans are literally made of corn; if you do a hair analysis, it's like a diet diary, and the vast majority of the American diet (corn-fed beef, fast foods and processed foods) contains corn derivatives. Much of the corn we ingest is in the guise of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), a cheaper alternative to sugar that is produced via a scary chemical conversion involving several toxic acids.  HFCS has been directly linked to the current obesity crisis and its impact on Type II Diabetes (the body processes HFCS differently from table sugar). Prior to the 1970s, hardly any company used HFCS due to its high cost. But after then-Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz did away with the old New Deal market control policies in favor of rapid expansion in 1973, there was a constant surplus of cheap (and non-edible) corn, fueling the rapid expansion of the corn syrup industry. Here's a quick test: walk into any convenience store and count how many items contain corn, specifically corn syrup. The list includes obvious choices like soda and candy, but you'll also find HFCS in deli meats, breads, ketchup, pickle relish, spaghetti sauce, and cough syrup.  Oh yes, and one main variety of corn grown in Iowa (Liberty) is genetically modified, as is at least one ingredient in HFCS manufacturing.<br /><br />Corn production geared towards ethanol is briefly mentioned, but the majority of the focus in King Corn is on the impact of non-edible corn on the nation's food supply. In this respect, it's kind of a gentler version of Supersize Me; there's no shock value for the most part. Also mentioned is the disastrous consequence of converting cattle from grazing animals to force-fed confined ones. Cattle normally forage for a plant-based diet, but it is far more profitable to bring them up to market weight by forcing them to stand still and eat continuously. In addition, the acids present in corn cause deadly ulcers for the cows, who are slaughtered before developing acidosis.  The end result is that 70% of the antibiotics in the US are used on livestock (antibiotics combat both the acidosis and the infections resulting from confinement).  Literally everything at McDonald's contains corn: your hamburger is corn-fed, the bun contains HFCS, your soda contains HFCS, the French fries are fried in corn (or soybean) oil, and your ketchup and pickle contains HFCS. Ditto for most vending machine foods, frozen dinners, and anything you don't make from scratch. It's extremely difficult to escape buying foods containing corn, since a variety of pseudonyms are used, including baking powder, caramel color, dextrose, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, stearic acid, and vanilla, making it a nightmare for anyone with corn allergies.<br /><br />Perhaps the most effective element is that of nostalgia. Ian and Curt also take time to find their long-lost relatives in Greene, and to reflect on the rapid changes in our recently agrarian society that have forced farmers to maintain massive farms harvesting non-edible corn. In other words, the farmer can't even feed himself with what he's growing. Without the hefty government subsidies, such large-scale corn operations would be out of business. They interview various farmers and ranchers who are disgusted with the system, but who have little real choice (one farmer says flatly, ""We're growing crap!""). We're shown the evolution of farming equipment and of the family farm itself as a quaint reminder of the past; there are nostalgic shots of Main Street and hometown parades, quiet diners and local bars.<br /><br />Ian and Curt's visual style is playful; the charts and graphs are hand-drawn, interspersed with stop-motion plastic farm toys to get the point across (and the dancing corn on the map of the US was great, too).  The quirky soundtrack is a standout as well. DVD extras include some outtakes, a music video, bios, and some great 1950s-style educational clips. King Corn is a thought-provoking look at the old adage ""You are what you eat,"" and boy, it's scary.",[],B0012680D0,B0012680D0,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1213499330000,192,False
4.0,Heartwarming adaptation of a classic novel,"Rodman Philbrick's [[ASIN:0439286069 Freak The Mighty (Scholastic Signature)]] is the tale of learning disabled Max (Elden Hensen), the son of incarcerated murderer ""Killer"" Kane (James Gandolfini, [[ASIN:B00003CXOP The Sopranos: The Complete First Season]]) and his friendship with Kevin (Kieran Culkin), a genius with Morquio's Syndrome (Ian Michael Smith from [[ASIN:0788815466 Simon Birch]] was also considered but turned down; a pity, since he actually *has* Morquio's Syndrome). Max has lived with his grim grandparents since the time that his father murdered his mother, and leads a painful existence at school. He rarely emerges from his basement room, terrified that he's too stupid and huge, and most importantly, that he takes after his homicidal father.<br /><br />When Kevin moves next door, Max only wants to be invisible and is humiliated when Kevin becomes his reading tutor. But the unexpected happens: Kevin introduces Max to the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and Max begins to harness the power of imagination. The two work out an arrangement where Max serves as Kevin's legs, and Kevin as Max's brain. The two are involved in several hair-raising adventures and flights of fancy until an unexpectedly violent event that changes both their lives. The screenplay stays fairly close to the original novel, which is a huge plus.<br /><br />The Mighty is a prime example of an all-star cast used to full advantage. Kieran Culkin, even though able-bodied, does an admirable job as brainiac Kevin without becoming a caricature of his disability. Harry Dean Stanton, Sharon Stone, James Gandolfini, Gillian Anderson, and Meat Loaf all put in memorable performances. Sting also contributes the obligatory theme song, topping off a soundtrack drenched in Renaissance Faire Celtic stylings.

3.0,Science fiction with heart,"Matthew Robbins's *Batteries Not Included is a charming little science-fiction heartwarmer produced by Steven Spielberg. Penned by Mick Garris and with help from Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille), it's the tale of a small tenement's fight for survival against corporate greed. As the opening credits roll to some divine swing courtesy of James Horner, we're shown vintage photographs of New York City and of Frank and Faye Riley (real-life Hollywood power couple Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy), owners of Riley's Cafe on the ground floor of their brownstone.<br /><br />Lacey, a greedy real estate developer, has hired some local goons led by Carlos (Michael Carmine) to buy out the remaining residents (the rest of the block has already been bulldozed in anticipation of new construction). This includes Frank and Faye, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, fellow friends Muriel and Sid, washed-up prize fighter Harry, Mason the artist, and Marisa, a pregnant single mother. They have nowhere else to go, so they band together against Lacey's thugs, who delight in harassing them and in further damaging the already-dilapidated building.<br /><br />Frank and Faye are the main focus; it's obvious that Faye is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. She has a very shaky grip on reality, frequently confuses the past with the present, and requires a high degree of supervision. But it's obvious from her bearing and her no-nonsense tone that Faye was (and is) a force to be reckoned with. She frequently asks about the whereabouts of her son Bobby, whose absence is explained near the film's finale. When Sid and Muriel take the buyout money and move to Jersey, Frank is heartbroken, knowing that he'll be unable to care for Faye by himself. Tandy can be a little over the top at times, but it's obvious that she enjoyed the role. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy are the reason you should rent this film; their tender love for each other despite the setbacks of age, illness, and adversity are inspiring, more so because they were married for over five decades.<br /><br />Enter a miracle: high-tech spaceships make their way to Frank and the other residents after a tearful prayer, and assist them with fixing and rebuilding. The special effects by ILM (Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic) are delightfully low-tech in contrast to our current age of CGI overload. The spaceships are quite obviously puppet models that were transposed into the shots, although they do have their own unique personalities.<br /><br />However, Lacey is less than thrilled with the new developments (his building permits are set to expire within days), and tries to hasten the building's demise, leading to some scenes of violence and tension between the residents and the developers.<br /><br />This is more a feel-good drama than a true science-fiction piece. It was originally slated to be used as part of Spielberg's [[ASIN:B00005JN8Q Amazing Stories - The Complete First Season]] series, but Spielberg liked it so much that he decided to make it into a full-length feature film. The set design is particularly noteworthy as all of the buildings were sets, since the producers were unable to find an existing property that met their criteria (there is some information included about the making of the film).<br /><br />James Horner's marvelously retro swing score is heavily in the style of Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey, and made Faye's dementia and recollection of WWII very poignant (Faye asks at the table, ""Whatever happened to General Eisenhower? You hardly read a word about him anymore""). To be honest, this was the first swing / Big Band soundtrack I ever remember hearing, and it stuck with me two decades later as my love for WWII music has spread to include Frank Sinatra's Columbia records, Harry James, and Big Band leaders.<br /><br />Although *Batteries Not Included may not have a heavy dose of action, or suspense, or ""serious"" drama, it does have a strong ensemble cast, a great soundtrack, decent special effects and is a heartwarming tale of trust and faith that the whole family can enjoy. It would have been nice if more extras had been included besides the original trailer and some behind the scenes still screens, but it's still a joy to see this once again.",[],0783232047,0783232047,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1212574563000,12,True
5.0,A trip down nostalgia lane...,"1998's Pleasantville is a charmingly executed parable about introducing change to a closed society, and the ripple effect that even the smallest changes can produce. Siblings David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are polar opposites; nerdy David is obsessed with the ficticious 1950s sitcom Pleasantville (an homage to Leave It To Beaver and other picture-perfect small-screen families), while Jennifer hangs out with the fast crowd, smoking and snaring potential dates.<br /><br />After a mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) gives the two a remote, they're transported into the black-and-white, picture-perfect town of Pleasantville, where the basketball team makes perfect baskets every shot and a nutritious dinner is always on the table (thanks, mom!). Horrified, the two at first try to desperately find a way back. David has the advantage of being intimately familiar with the Pleasantville universe, and tries to steer Jennifer away from any seismic outbursts that would be out of place in placid Pleasantville, such as swearing, smoking, and heaven forbid, s-e-x. Jennifer has her own agenda, though, and Lovers Lane soon becomes more than just a place to stargaze and hold hands. With each change comes the slow but sure colorization: first bubblegum turns pink, then the more ""adventurous"" teens end up in color.<br /><br />David and Jennifer's ""parents,"" George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen) Parker, are stamped straight out of 1950s legend; George begins every evening by announcing ""honey, I'm home!"" and Betty's always on call to whip up massive breakfasts or hors d'oeuvres. David, now ""Bud,"" works in the burger joint owned by Bill (Jeff Daniels), who's paralyzed by indecision and any break in routine. But a funny thing happens; the once-wild Jennifer slowly becomes more scholarly and more and more like her TV counterpart than her former ""bad girl"" self, while once-timid David learns to stand up for himself and to fight for what he believes in.<br /><br />In Pleasantville, the old guard is threatened by all of the changes: the once-empty books in the library are filled, Bill realizes his life's dream of becoming a painter, using every shade under the sun, rockabilly and rock and roll are heard...resulting in violence and trials that parallel McCarthyism. Betty and other wives begin to yearn for a fulfilling life outside of the home, leaving their husbands hungry and confused.<br /><br />Although the visual metaphors are heavy-handed at times, Pleasantville does an admirable job at capturing the balance between modern uncertainties (at school, the teens are given sobering statistics about AIDS, global warming, and underemployment) and our rose-tinted nostalgia for the past. The visual design deserves special mention, and the classic soundtrack is loaded with gems by Pat Boone, Miles Davis, Etta James, Elvis and Buddy Holly. Pleasantville was nominated for two dozen awards, and it's easy to see why. A delightful film for the entire family.",[],6305308659,6305308659,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211772185000,1,False
4.0,"Formulaic tearjerker, but a heartwarming one","Follow the Stars Home, based on the book of the same name by Luanne Rice, is the story of Dianne (Kimberly Williams), a young woman in love with handsome sailor Mark McCune (Eric Close). The two begin a whirlwind courtship and marriage, but when Dianne discovers that the baby she is carrying will be born with severe neurological and physical disabilities, Mark walks out, leaving Dianne to raise Julia (Amanda and Caitlin Fein) alone, with only her mother to help her.<br /><br />Mark's brother David (Campbell Scott), a doctor, offers to help Dianne raise Julia by providing medical checkups and support, and is worried about Dianne's health as sole caretaker. Meanwhile, Amy (Alexa Vega, Spy Kids) a girl from a troubled home, becomes a ""mother's helper"" to Dianne and her mother.<br /><br />The rest of the film plays out as a more-or-less formulaic story, with the prerequisite dose of angst, guilt, hospital visits, abusive boyfriends, and self-pity thrown in, before the (anticlimactic) conclusion. However, Dianne fails to fall into the ""martyred mother of a handicapped child"" camp. I personally know several acquaintances who have handicapped children (one has a daughter with lissencephaly who is nonverbal, cannot sit up, crawl, or roll over, and has multiple seizures every day), and Dianne's steadfast devotion to Julia at the expense of her own health (and occasionally happiness) rings true. It takes a great deal of courage and love to be a lifetime caretaker of a severely handicapped child, and Kimberly Williams' portrayal was one of the best things about the movie.<br /><br />Mark's role as the now-you-see-him, now-you-don't ex was less successful; his limited dialogue doesn't really allow much in the way of character development, and his subsequent appearances felt forced and unnecessary. David fares better as the loyal ""fifth wheel"" whose feelings for Dianne are largely ignored throughout most of the movie, yet he still gives his time to help Julia. Stage actress Blair Brown as Hannah, Dianne's mother, brought a degree of strength and wisdom that served as a direct counterpoint to Amy's drunken mother Tess (Roxanne Hart).<br /><br />Follow the Stars Home is generally family-friendly, with the exception of Tess's physically abusive boyfriend (there is a scene involving animal cruelty as well as physical violence towards a child). However, the slow pace and adult plot will likely bore younger audiences.<br /><br />Overall, this was a decent enough love story about mothers and daughters, second chances, and learning to trust that should appeal to fans of the original novel, and fits in well with the usual Hallmark Hall of Fame demographic.",[],B00005YNRH,B00005YNRH,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211716324000,14,True
3.0,Formulaic romance starring...Napa Valley,"Alfonso Arau (Like Water For Chocolate)'s WWII romance A Walk in the Clouds, based on the 1942 Italian film Quattro passi fra le nuvole, explores the intertwined notions of destiny and true love amidst a sprawling vineyard. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) returns home from the front to discover that the woman he married shortly before shipping out (a cameo by Debra Messing from [[ASIN:B00009Y3RW Will & Grace - Season One]]) isn't the woman he wants to spend his life with; she couldn't handle the realities of war, so she saved his heartfelt letters without reading them.<br /><br />Before the war, he was a chocolate salesman, but he is dissatisfied with civilian life and suffers from PTSD. Aboard a train, he meets Victoria (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n), a beautiful woman traveling alone. She was pursuing her master's degree in literature, but became pregnant. Victoria has nowhere to go but home to her domineering father Alberto and his winery, and Paul offers to be her ""husband"" to make her pregnancy appear legitimate to her family. Once at the vineyard, Paul is convinced by Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn, apparently reprising his role in [[ASIN:B0001XALGY Zorba the Greek]]) to stay and help with the yearly harvest. Paul gradually becomes accepted by Victoria's very traditional Mexican family, and pitches in to help with the backbreaking labor involved in maintaining the vineyard.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest tragedy is the waste of what could have been: the romance is strictly by-the-numbers, and Keanu's painfully wooden delivery (he redefines the word ""monotone"") does little to soften already formulaic dialogue. Painful drunken serenades featuring Reeves and Quinn, an absurdly shot ""flap like a butterfly"" sequence, and hokey harvest montages featuring a choir chanting ""crush the grapes"" do little to cleanse the palette. However, the gorgeous twilight shots of Napa Valley (filmed on location at various wineries including Beringer, Duckhorn, Haywood, Mount Vedeer, and Mayacamus) are pure sun-drenched bliss. It's a shame that the script doesn't hold up as well. As with many modern remakes of foreign films such as the recent [[ASIN:B00005JPSM No Reservations]] based on [[ASIN:B00007ELFA Mostly Martha]], the producers would have done well to study the source material more closely; the charm and wit that made these films classics in their original languages are lost in translation trying to produce a product geared towards American audiences. A Walk in the Clouds lacks the sensuality and mysticism of Arau's captivating Mexican fable [[ASIN:6305428476 Like Water for Chocolate]], or even the American [[ASIN:B00005K3OT Chocolat (Miramax Collector's Series)]]. If you enjoyed Like Water for Chocolate, then you will likely find some redeeming qualities in A Walk in the Clouds, but for everyone else, I'd recommend a different vintage.",[],B00006ZXSI,B00006ZXSI,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211713778000,1,False
4.0,Another great supernatural show that wasn't given a chance to shine...,"Fox's New Amsterdam revolves around John Amsterdam, an immortal detective working in NYC. At first glance, New Amsterdam's plot would appear similar to that of [[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy, Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]], [[ASIN:B000WFW12S Moonlight]], and [[ASIN:B00344EAG4 Blood Ties: The Complete Series]], all of which feature vampires investigating human crimes. However, John was granted immortality for his selfless sacrifice: he placed himself in front of a Native American woman during a fierce battle, and was fatally stabbed. The shaman that he saved restored him, telling him that he should remain immortal until he met his soulmate.<br /><br />Flash-forward a few hundred years, and John's now working as a homicide detective in NYC. He confides his doubts and concerns to his best friend Omar, the only other person to know his secret, and his current dog, 36. Over John's many lifetimes, he's fathered dozens of children, dated hundreds of women, only to watch them age and wither as he remains untouched by the ravages of time. He's a recovering alcoholic who hasn't had a drink since the 1960s. He's honed several talents including photography, painting and woodworking (he creates ""antique"" desks that sell for large sums). But he feels that something is missing until he suffers a massive heart attack while chasing a suspect on a crowded subway platform. He feels that it was the pain in his heart that the shaman foretold, and that his true love must have been on the same platform.<br /><br />Meanwhile, his new partner Eva Marquez is as green as they come, and John ends up being a sort of mentor even as he searches for the mystery woman on the subway platform. Eva and John are assigned to a variety of homicides, and the show loses momentum on the procedural as the cases that they investigate aren't particularly memorable and exist only to further the plot (and parallel flashbacks to John's earlier lives similar to Forever Knight).<br /><br />Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, a Danish actor, does a good job of conveying John's anguish at having to leave behind loved ones, and of capturing John's unique skills on the job acquired through hundreds of years of experience. He has a slight accent that drifts between general American and ""other,"" which isn't terribly distracting given as his character grew up speaking Dutch. The visual design also deserves a special mention, particularly during flashbacks, and the opening credits are some of the most visually imaginative I've seen.<br /><br />New Amsterdam was originally scheduled as a 13-episode series, but was put in as a mid-season replacement and only aired for eight episodes. Despite being ended mid-season, the writers had been steering the story in an obvious direction. It's a shame that New Amsterdam won't have a chance to play out; despite some flaws in the homicide procedurals, the flashbacks were executed with style and wit.

4.0,Another fine example of Canadian humor...that you'll never see in the US,"I first read about Bon Cop, Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rail's magazine, and I was instantly intrigued. I'd seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago, and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the [[ASIN:B0006HM1TA Les Boys 1, 2 and 3 (Box Set)]] hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months, and specialized in Quebec Studies (history, literature, and cinema) as an undergraduate, so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political, social, and cultural reasons. Bon Cop, Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes (English- and French-speaking Canada).<br /><br />A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops: Torontonian Martin Ward, (Colm Feore) a by-the-book, prim-and-proper intellectual, and rough-and-tumble David Bouchard, a shoot first, ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally, the two despise each other at first sight, and the rapid-fire bilingual one-liners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the get-go. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced, unnatural balance of bilingual script, but as someone who's trilingual, I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends; nothing unnatural there.<br /><br />Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David, Ontario and Quebec; there are numerous in-jokes regarding Canadian law, stereotypes of Quebeckers (diehard smokers, dangerous drivers, womanizers) and Torontonians (cold, boring, workaholics) and nods to popular Canadian culture (Rick Mercer of [[ASIN:B000W00XXW This Hour Has 22 Minutes-Season 1]] does a great Don Cherry impression, Uniprix commercial spoof, cameo by Nanette Workman). There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two (fully bilingual) detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine, from a speed-talking coroner (Quebecois comedian Louis-José Houde) to Martin's glamorous, hip sister who's hot for David, as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an $8 million budget.<br /><br />In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like [[ASIN:B00006FDCT Strange Brew]] and [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]] (a curling ""comedy"" from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of [[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]]), Bon Cop, Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime, hockey. Of course, beer, curling, beavers, and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances, as does marijuana (there is a priceless scene involving a self-destructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy [[ASIN:B00003CXMY Saving Grace]]). Romantic interest? Check. (You'll never think of ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" quite the same way again...) Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain, who is never really developed; we never know, or care, why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing (nearly all in French) that seemed over-the-top, but it's obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.<br /><br />Looking at these elements separately, Bon Cop, Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely ""Canadian"" comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin, David and their respective families (both men are divorced single parents), and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances, and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English- and French-speaking Canada. This is a gem that deserves to be seen!",[],B0015UKX4M,B0015UKX4M,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211127988000,23,False

Beth has the strangest sensation of déjà vu about Mick, which turns out to be a pivotal point in later episodes. Mick meets Beth while the two are researching the same murder case, and they eventually team up. In the tradition of Anne Rice's Louis, Mick loathes being a vampire, mainly because he wasn't given a choice in the matter.<br /><br />Frankly, at first Moonlight left me unimpressed, beginning with the vampire clichés that Mick deadpans, and the cheesy special effects in the first couple of episodes (along with forgettable villains). However, Moonlight oozes style from every pore,  with eyecatching set design (Mick's crystal-burning fireplace is eye-popping) and decent vamp effects (eerie ice-blue contacts, the ability to move quickly and jump great heights). The prerequisite angsty alternative soundtrack includes Evanescence's ""My Immortal"" ([[ASIN:B000089RVX Fallen]]), Mazzy Star's ""Into Dust""([[ASIN:B000002V07 So Tonight That I Might See]]), Nine Inch Nails ""Mr. Self Destruct"" ([[ASIN:B000001Y5Z The Downward Spiral]]), Maroon Five's ""Can't Stop"" ([[ASIN:B000P2A256 It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]) and Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"" ([[ASIN:B000002KE5 School's Out]]) are prominently featured, suiting the gorgeous aerial shots of LA (a vast improvement over the nighttime ultralight panoramas of Toronto featured in Forever Knight).<br /><br />And Moonlight turns some vamp conventions on their head; Mick's able to walk about during the day for limited amounts of time, for one, and instead of coffins, vamps sleep in deep freezers (I pity the houseguest who goes looking for frozen peas in *that* deep freezer!).  Also, the flashbacks are generally well done, particularly the vintage music such as Louis Jordan's ""Ain't that Just Like A Woman"").<br /><br />The show improved and changed my opinion of it, and it's a pity that it was cancelled. I look forward to owning Moonlight on DVD. If you're a fan of Moonlight, you'll also want to check out the excellent Canadian series [[ASIN:B00344EAG4 Blood Ties: The Complete Series]], which features a human PI paired with a vampire as the two explore paranormal cases.",[],B000WFW12S,B000WFW12S,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1211113192000,64,False
3.0,"A generally solid biopic, although it loses its footing at times","Music Within is a biopic revolving around Richard Pimentel, a wounded Vietnam vet whose efforts at finding jobs for fellow wounded vets along with his friendship with Art Honeyman, a writer with severe cerebral palsy, led to Richard's widespread workplace disability training and the eventual creation and adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.<br /><br />However, despite solid performances by Ron Livingston as Richard, Melissa George as his love interest Christine, and Michael Sheen as Art, the film falls into predictable pitfalls. First, as a Vietnam-era biopic, with the vintage soundtrack and generic battlefield sequences, Music Within feels like it could have been pulled from [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0002V7ON8 Born on the Fourth of July (Special Edition)]] or any number of films revolving around Vietnam vets' painful readjustments to civilian life. Livingston is simply too old to pull off a convincing teenage Richard, and the scenes of Richard's early childhood are awkward and strike a sour note. The role of Christine, Richard's love interest, was one-dimensional and instantly forgettable (she appears when the script requires it, other than that she's off practicing ""free love"" with her other boyfriends).<br /><br />As a ""disabled"" film, there are moments that reminded me strongly of [[ASIN:B00005JNV9 Rory O'Shea Was Here]], an Irish indie film starring James McAvoy and Steven Robertson as wheelchair-bound rebels, one with muscular dystrophy and the other with severe cerebral palsy. Art's CP also brought to mind Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in [[ASIN:B00008L3RY My Left Foot (Special Edition)]], which also leads me to my next observation: despite comments from directors, surely there must be professional actors with actual cerebral palsy. Despite well-meaning portrayals, having able-bodied actors attempt to recreate the symptoms of CP, even if done well, always feels like a cheap shot to me, and at times Michael Sheen's performance borders on caricature. Also, despite a split-second scene of Richard's speech therapy class, the onscreen portrayal of lipreading is highly inaccurate.<br /><br />The sloppy script lacks any real drama, and I agree with a reviewer who stated that the film would have been much more powerful if Art had been the narrator instead of Richard. The '70s is merely set dressing, and there is no sense of any real passage of time other than hairstyles. Despite the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos from Rebecca De Mornay, Hector Elizondo, and Leslie Nielsen, the film came off feeling unpopulated, focusing on Richard's quest with little real depth or insight, despite the backstory of his seeking acceptance from his mentally ill mother. There are numerous continuity goofs in respect to period details, but the sound editing, distorted at times to reflect Richard's tinnitus, is effective.<br /><br />Overall, Music Within still had its moments, particularly from the razor-sharp wit of Art's painfully delivered lines (which, per other films with CP characters, are mostly unintelligible). Much like the device used in Rory O'Shea, Richard serves as Art's mouthpiece when dealing with other people since he is the only (!) person who can understand him. There is a lot of heavy profanity, drinking, and drug use by the Vietnam vets and several scenes involving death, so if you're sensitive to any of these, consider yourself forewarned. The DVD also features deleted scenes (nothing special), a commentary, several trailers for other films, and a keynote speech from the real Richard Pimentel.",[],B0013LRKYO,B0013LRKYO,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1210467891000,4,False
5.0,Little pitchers have big ears...,"Hallmark Hall of Fame's charming What the Deaf Man Heard, based upon the novel What the Deaf-Mute Heard by G.D.Gearino and teleplay by Robert Lenski, follows the misadventures of Sammy Ayers (young Sammy is played by Frankie Muniz, adult Sammy by Matthew Modine), who grows up deaf and orphaned in a small Southern town. Sammy was traveling with his mother (Bernadette Peters) when she suddenly disappeared, leaving him alone and frightened. Her last words to him were, ""Not a word,"" and Sammy takes this as Gospel, refusing to utter a single syllable to the townsfolk who try to help him. Naturally, they think that he is a deaf-mute, and bachelor bus depot owner Norm Jenkins (Tom Skerritt) takes him in.<br /><br />As Sammy grows into adulthood, he does simple odd jobs around the community. People are kind to him, yet treat him as invisible due to his ""deafness"" and speak openly about town gossip and family secrets. Sammy becomes caught up in the illegal dealings and ""holier than thou"" posturing of the oily Tolliver Tynan (Jake Weber), and at the same time is attracted to Tolliver's sister Tallassee (Anne Bobby). There is also a subplot involving Archibald Thacker (James Earl Jones) and his sons, who are producing moonshine, and Sammy feels that he has to step in before things get out of hand.<br /><br />This is a charming film about family above all, and the many seasoned actors (Modine, Skerritt, Jones, Peters) turn in memorable performances. What the Deaf Man Heard really captures the period feel during flashbacks, and the small Southern community is practically a cast member. This is one of my favorite Hallmark Hall of Fame presentations since all of the elements come together so well, and is perfect for the whole family to enjoy.",[],B00004WI58,B00004WI58,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1207697322000,1,False
4.0,An eye-opening look at the Ellis Island experience,"As the granddaughter of Polish immigrants (my grandmother immigrated to the US from Zamosc, Poland in 1917 when she was four years old), I grew up hearing stories about Ellis Island from my grandmother (who had quite a large collection of books on Ellis Island), and also read a number of novels and watched documentaries ([[ASIN:B00007GZYA Ellis Island]]) on the immigrant experience.<br /><br />However, reading first-hand accounts of the events and seeing them brought to life on the big screen made quite a difference. Golden Door (released as New World in Italy) follows the Sicilian Mancuso family, headed by persnickety grandmother Fortunata, her son Salvatore, and his sons Angelo and Pietro. Salvatore is barely able to scratch a living from the rocky, unforgiving landscape (shown to perfection in haunting aerial shots), and after many false starts, begins to make arrangements to go to America. Fortunata has no desire to join them, and Pietro, a deaf-mute, identifies more closely with her. The first third of the film involves Salvatore's selling of his goods to finance the voyage, and the preparations that have to be made. Along the way, Salvatore meets the beautiful, mysterious Englishwoman Lucy, who is traveling in Sicily by herself and attempts to travel with the Mancusos.<br /><br />The middle of the film chronicles the ocean steamship crossing, with its cramped, segregated male/female quarters, and a rough storm at sea. To be honest, the scenes of the living arrangements seemed too quiet from what I've read; when Lucy gets up at night, there's nary a peep (no young children on this ship, apparently). Also slightly disappointing was the fact that when they finally arrived in New York, there was no (standard) shot of the immigrants glimpsing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.<br /><br />The final third deals with the Mancuso's fairly typical experience at Ellis Island, and this is where the film shines. Director Emanuele Crialese really did his homework on the battery of physical and psychological tests performed on prospective immigrants in order to determine their ""fitness"" for life in the United States, and it's slightly shocking by modern standards to see the humiliation that some were subjected to. The American Ellis Island staff in the film come off as cold and unconcerned, particularly with the heartbreaking situation of some of the ""mail-order brides"" forced into marriage after a dangerous ocean crossing. However, Crialese did include (brief) glimpses at other immigrants, including Eastern European Jewish, Middle Eastern, and other European countries. Small touches of wonder at their new situation are alternately funny and touching, such as immigrants scaling the frosted glass windows to look across the harbor, where they contemplate living in a skyscraper, or Salvatore's result of a block puzzle.<br /><br />Crialese chose to shoot the film in Buenos Aires and personally chose all 700 extras, most of whom are descendants of Italian immigrants to Argentina. The scenery is effective, and the film was digitally colored to leach out bright hues, resulting in an appropriately washed-out, aged look (although not as garish as Tim Burton's use of digital coloring in Sweeny Todd). The [[ASIN:B000N6U1GO Golden Door]] soundtrack includes folk songs, a hint of tango, and symphonic interludes, and works well with the visuals. An in-depth making-of features interviews in French and Italian (funny to hear the Italian lead Vincenzo Amato interviewing in French rather than his native Italian, but his French is quite good).<br /><br />My only dislike of the film was the inserted ""dream sequences"" that featured hallucinations of giant vegetables and rivers of milk (the end sequence was downright creepy in an Andy Warhol kind of way). As Salvatore didn't strike me as lighthearted, these ""hallucinations"" come across as forced rather than a natural extension of his personality and took away from some of the gravity of the immigrant experience presented here.<br /><br />Overall, this is a lushly realized look at the immigrant experience, including the many sacrifices and dangers along the way that are sometimes overlooked due to the romanticized view of the immigrant experience. Crialese has created a timeless tribute to the sacrifice of our grandparents who gave up everything (not just family living in the Old World, but often their language, culture, and customs) at the chance for a better life in America.",[],B000X418UY,B000X418UY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205926255000,3,False
5.0,A gustatory journey through Paris,"Ratatouille, from Pixar and Brad Bird ([[ASIN:B00005JN4W The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00009M9BK The Iron Giant (Special Edition)]]), is a rat's-eye view of the gastronomic delights of fine cuisine (the name itself is a pun on the classic French roast vegetable dish ratatouille). Remy is a young rat who discovers that he has a heightened sense of taste and smell, and becomes inspired by the late television chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), whose motto ""anyone can cook"" now extends to rats, too. Remy begins to experiment with combining classic combinations of flavor and texture, herbs, and other ingredients, until his clan is forced to flee their country safehouse.<br /><br />During the traumatic escape, Remy is separated from his family. The ghost of Chef Gusteau appears to Remy when he is discouraged, inspiring him to cook at Gusteau's formerly-five star restaurant. The acid restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) made it his personal mission to write a scathing review of Gusteau's that stripped it of one of its Michelin stars, consigning it to the tourist trade. Now, the restaurant is under the iron fist of the shady, domineering Head Chef Skinner (Ian Holm). Remy befriends the bumbling, couldn't-boil-water-if-his-life-depended-on-it Alfredo Linguini, whom Skinner grudgingly adopted as the new garbage boy, and Remy and Linguini team up to create culinary delights that astound the normally staid French restaurant critics. Remy controls Linguini by hiding under his chef's toque and tugging on two strands of hair (the scenes of Remy perfecting his technique with a blindfolded Linguini wielding dangerous tools and messy ingredients are priceless). Toss in a handful of intrigue, kitchen highjinks, father-son bonding, a dash of romance with the formidable chef Colette, and plenty of culinary delights, and you have Ratatouille.<br /><br />The 3D animation is photorealistic, and 360 shots of nighttime Paris entrance. Small touches really capture the Bohemian feel of the Montmartre district, and the soundtrack features (brief) snippets of La Marseillaise, light and airy French themes, and French-language vocals by Camille (the standalone soundtrack [[ASIN:B000PKG7HK Ratatouille]] is available for purchase). As with The Incredibles, there's lots to keep kids engaged (although the scene with the window full of dead rats might be traumatic for very young kids), and a whole other layer of adult humor bubbling under the surface, so mom and dad will be able to enjoy Ratatouille with gusto.",[],B000VBJEEG,B000VBJEEG,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205463307000,0,False
5.0,"""Come back to me.""","I'm not sure how old I was the first time I watched our beat-up VHS copy of Somewhere in Time; it had to be several years after my first visit to Mackinac Island at age four. Over the years, I've come to greatly appreciate the nuances (and standalone merits) of this most gentle and unique love story.<br /><br />The charming time-travel love story Somewhere in Time is based on Richard Matheson's Bid Time Return. The book is a deeply rewarding journey that reaches nuances and depths not present in the screen version, and is worth reading to compare. In the screen adaptation Somewhere in Time, Matheson also served as the screenwriter, lending the movie an unerring fidelity to the original work.<br /><br />Richard Collier (Christopher Reeve in his first role after [[ASIN:B000059Z8J Superman - The Movie]]) is a modern-day playwright in Chicago. As the film opens at a cast party for his latest work, an elderly woman walks up to him, instantly hushing the celebratory atmosphere, and deposits an engraved pocket watch in his hand, muttering, ""come back to me."" Richard brushes this off as the ravings of a senile woman until later, when a photograph shatters his indifference. Later, Richard seeks a weekend escape at Mackinac Island, Michigan after hitting the wall on his new work.<br /><br />Once checked into the Grand Hotel (one of the world's largest vintage summer resorts, with the world's longest covered patio facing Lake Michigan), he is haunted by the sensual photograph of a beautiful woman in the Grand Hotel's Hall of History, and races to dig up any and all information on the luminous beauty (leading to some fabulous shots of recognizable structures on Mackinac Island). Elise McKenna (Jane Seymour) was a promising young stage actress managed by the dour, possessive W.F. Robinson (Christopher Plummer). Richard toys with the idea of self-hypnosis to travel back to 1912 in order to meet Elise when she was performing at the Grand Hotel, and after several attempts, he succeeds (or is it only the product of a desperate and haunted imagination?), and begins a slow wooing of Elise. Humorous ""fish out of water"" mishaps plague modern-day Richard, including wearing an antique suit that was already an antique by 1912, and the dangers of shaving with a straight razor.<br /><br />The phrase ""love at first sight"" doesn't quite capture the haunting sense of deja vu when Richard first speaks to Elise on the shore of Lake Michigan. A stricken Elise simply asks, ""Is it you?"" and Richard answers yes. It's as though the two have known each other for decades, or at least sensed the other's presence (the mechanics of said time travel, including the ""pocket watch loophole,"" are shaky at best). Their courtship is nearly thwarted by the machinations of the insanely jealous Robinson, who views Elise as his protegee (and property).<br /><br />The bittersweet romance comes to a tragic end, much in the same vein as [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]] (which is a very similar ghost love story set in coastal England, but minus the time travel), but ultimately has a fulfilling ending.<br /><br />The cinematography of the 1912 portion is appropriately dreamy, with soft light permeating outdoor shots. The film's soundtrack by John Barry is quite possibly the most romantic I've ever heard, centered around a Rachmaninoff variation on a theme by Paganini. [[ASIN:B00000AFYL Somewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording)]] was quite literally the soundtrack of my youth; we would play it on trips to Northern Michigan, and on Mackinac Island in particular. Even if you never see the movie, it's worth purchasing the rerecorded Somewhere In Time soundtrack.<br /><br />Reeve, Seymour, and Plummer all put in heartfelt performances, and the true star of the show is Mackinac Island and the Grand Hotel in particular. Although long valued as a Midwest summer resort, Mackinac Island became an international tourist destination with the cult status of Somewhere in Time.<br /><br />The 20th-anniversary DVD features a one-hour documentary on the making of Somewhere in Time, with new interviews by the late Christopher Reeve (after being paralyzed from the neck down after a horseback accident in 1995), Jane Seymour, Christopher Plummer, and other actors and crewmembers including director Jeannot Szwarc. Also included are cast and crew bios, production stills and notes, an audio commentary by Szwarc (I haven't listened to it yet, so I can't comment), a still photo gallery, the original theatrical trailer, and a segment on INSITE, the International Network of Somewhere in Time Enthusiasts. All in all, the bonus features lend new depth for diehard fans of the movie, but will probably not interest casual fans.",[],B00004W46I,B00004W46I,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205460433000,2,False

4.0,Knight. Nick Knight.,"Before [[ASIN:B000TLTCU4 Angel - Complete Series Collector's Set]], before [[ASIN:B000WHO98K Moonlight]], before Blood Ties, there was Forever Knight, a Canadian vampire detective thriller that ran from 1992-1996. Shown on CBS and the Sci-Fi Channel in the US, Forever Knight has a large cult following that helped to finally petition for the series' complete release on DVD by running full-page ads in trade magazines and through e-mail and letter writing campaigns.<br /><br />Forever Knight is the journey of Nick Knight (Geraint Wyn Davies), a 700-year-old French vampire who seeks to atone for his sins through public service. In his latest reincarnation, he's a Toronto homicide detective working the night shift. Paired with Detective Don Schanke (John Kapelos), Nick investigates some of the most brutal Toronto homicides, including drive-by shootings (this was ten years before Toronto's gangs made international headlines for innocent bystanders killed in gang warfare in public places), death by arson, and serial killers. The cases contain a good deal of procedural elements related to the coroner, Dr. Natalie Lambert (Catherine Disher), the only mortal to know of Nick's vampirism.<br /><br />Nick's former vamp flame Janette (Deborah Duchenne) runs the vampire/Goth bar The Raven, and Nick goes to Janette for clues on cases, as well as the occasional solace. Nick and Natalie search desperately for a scientific cure to regain mortality, even as Nick's controlling vampire master Lucien LaCroix (Nigel Bennett) tightens his grasp on his happy little vampire ""family.""<br /><br />The shows are opened by a teaser, followed by parallel storylines that follow the current homicide investigation and are interspersed with flashbacks from Nick's vampiric past that have some similarity to the case at hand. The original pilot was aired in 1989 and starred Rick Springfield as Nick. The only carryover to the current cast was John Kapelos as Schanke. Nick Knight was reshot as the two-part series pilot Dark Knight.<br /><br />First-season standouts include Last Act, Dance By The Light of the Moon, Feeding the Beast, in which Nick publicly faces his addiction (although he doesn't specify that ""the bottle"" contains cow's blood!), Spin Doctor (Nick on trial in 1954 Chicago for suspected Communist ties), and For I Have Sinned (Nick must face his fear and loathing of churches and religious symbols).<br /><br />Video quality looks dark and grainy, though that may be because the series was shot on videotape and at night / in dark locations. I felt like Columbia could have spent more time cleaning it up for as long as fans had to wait for the first-season set. Also, 0 stars for 0 extras, minus a couple of trailers for other Columbia Tristar supernatural flicks. No commentaries, no bloopers, nothing. Disappointing, as the original retail value of the box was $80.<br /><br />The writing is generally good, and care is taken with period costuming, speech styles, and set dressing. For a low budget, the cast and crew did a great job capturing the atmosphere of various historical periods, and of modern-day Toronto. Some of the foreign language dialogue is obviously subpar (except for Deborah Duchenne, who is a French speaker), as are some of the ""foreign"" accents.<br /><br />This may be the only TV show I know of that's shot in Toronto out of hundreds a year that actually portrays Toronto in all its former glory -- there are gratuitous shots of the now-defunct Sam the Record Man on Yonge Street with its spinning neon discs, the CN Tower, Skydome, and other landmarks. Anyone familiar with Toronto will instantly recognize street names and other locations. I spent many teenaged summers traipsing about Toronto for a week, so it felt like a homecoming of sorts.<br /><br />Although it's shameful about the lack of extras and that the video quality wasn't cleaned up more, it's great to have Nick Knight back in the fold once more.",[],B0000C23T1,B0000C23T1,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205459714000,2,False
2.0,"Highly stylized, but an empty shell of a great novel","As an adolescent, I loved Annette Curtis Klause's [[ASIN:0385734212 Blood and Chocolate]], the gripping tale of a modern-day werewolf pack. In the film adaptation by Katja Von Garnier (screenplay by Christopher B. Landon and Ehren Kruger), Vivian (Agnes Bruckner) and her pack live in Bucharest, Romania after fleeing a massacre in the United States. The solitary Vivian jogs, works in a chocolate shop, and avoids the advances of her cousin Rafe and his slimy friends. At night, she sips absinthe in trendy basement clubs. One night she runs into graphic novelist Aiden (Hugh Dancy), who is working on a piece about the loup-garou (werewolves), and Aiden seems to speak her language, viewing werewolves as noble.<br /><br />Vivian tries to shake Aiden's interest in her, as she is destined to become leader Gabriel's (Olivier Martinez) wife and future leader. However, the two eventually become involved, with tragic consequences for all involved. The so-called romance felt forced and unrealistic.<br /><br />The film is very dark and violent, with several scenes of pack hunting, vigilante justice, and graphic murders. It seemed to be all style and no substance; sure, the location footage of Bucharest looked beautiful, but served no purpose to further the story. There was no integration with local culture, and the trendy clubs could have been in any major European city.<br /><br />What little plot there was focused on vengeance, with shamefully little devoted to the werewolf lore that was the center of the original novel. In the film, there are no special effects when the humans (rarely) change into werewolves; instead, we're shown a brief blur that dissolves into real wolves. Disappointing to say the least; given, it's not a human in a bad werewolf suit, but none of the mystery or romance from the original novel is there. The chase scenes were heavy handed and overused, as were the numerous club scenes. The violence was gratuitous and largely without merit, but not scary enough to make this a horror film.<br /><br />Other than the names of several characters, little has been preserved from the original novel, and that's a shame. Klause penned beautiful descriptions of the change from human to werewolf, and of Vivian's delight in her dual sensual natures. In the original novel, Vivian is wrapped up in school and the pack hierarchy, and in many ways is a normal teenager interested in art and music. In the film version, Vivian feels empty; we never know what she enjoys, we never see her at school or with friends. Instead of the well-outlined pack hierarchy in the novel, Olivier Martinez's Gabriel is focused on protecting the pack through violence; there is none of the code of honor featured in the novel, and the werewolves' code is much more animalistic here. In the novel, Klause makes it possible to sympathize with the pack members who have all suffered personal loss and tragedy because of what they are; here, we never meet (or care about) the faceless pack members that exist only to kill humans.<br /><br />The DVD offers several deleted scenes, a commentary from Olivier Martinez, and widescreen and fullscreen versions.<br /><br />Final verdict: next time, stick closer to the source material. Some changes may have given the story a fresh new face, but the screenwriters basically rewrote the entire Blood and Chocolate story without any of the romance or wonder.",[],B000OCY7TY,B000OCY7TY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205457641000,0,False

Fry, which explored the Celtic legend of the selkie, seals that can turn into humans. Ten-year-old Fiona has been living in the city, but is sent to live with her grandparents on a remote island in Donegal, Ireland. She plunges into the mystery of the disappearance of her younger brother Jamie, and along the way meets her strange cousin Tadhg (John Lynch), who tells her the story of her selkie ancestor. Fiona is consumed with her quest to find her brother, whom she's seen swimming with the seals, and to convince her grandparents that she's telling the truth.<br /><br />The cinematography of craggy Donegal is beautifully shot, bringing to life the small fishing community where Fiona's family lives. Flashbacks capably illustrate the unusual pedigree of Fiona's ancestors, and it's telling that child Fiona has no trouble in understanding Tadhg, while adults write him off as odd. There are excellent performances all around, including the perhaps-familiar-to-American-audiences brother-and-sister team of John and Susan Lynch ([[ASIN:6304698690 The Secret Garden]], [[ASIN:6305210411 Sliding Doors]], [[ASIN:B000ZOXDFA Elizabeth - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)]]) and Mick Lally ([[ASIN:6304884389 Circle of Friends]], [[ASIN:B0009PLLN6 Alexander - Director's Cut (Full Screen Edition)]]) as Fiona's grandfather.<br /><br />The film's soundtrack by Mason Daring also deserves special mention. A unique blend of haunting original score, Celtic jigs, and Irish-language vocals, it captures the maritime feel of rural Ireland as well as moves the movie along through some of the more haunting dream sequences.<br /><br />This is a gentle film that is slow to unfold, but one that is ultimately rewarding and perfect for family viewing.",[],B00004TJKJ,B00004TJKJ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205457438000,0,False
4.0,Fans of Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Somewhere in Time will adore Portrait of Jennie,"Jennifer Jones ([[ASIN:B00008LDO7 The Song of Bernadette]]) and Joseph Cotten star in Portrait of Jennie, a 1948 film that revolved around a painter's obsession with a beautiful, mysterious girl who seems to live more in the past than the present. Eben Adams (Cotten) is a washed-up painter on hard times and lacks inspiration until he meets Jennie (Jones) in a New York park. Jennie has an unusual way of speaking about past events as though they are current (referring to Germany's kaiser, and to theaters that had been demolished). Her fresh-faced beauty appeals to Adams, and Jennie makes the wish that he wait for her to grow up so that they can be together.<br /><br />Jennie's sporadic appearances allow time for Eben to work on other commissions, and to research Jennie more carefully by interviewing people who had worked with her parents (famous high-wire circus performers). Inevitably, dark truths are uncovered that disturb Eben's ""painting-perfect"" romance with the soft-spoken, beautiful Jennie. His portrait of her is a testament to his love and brings him artistic fame. Eben is also introduced to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore), a headstrong old maid who deals in paintings and who wants to see Eben produce something more spiritual. Other notable names include Lillian Gish as Mother Mary of Mercy, Cecil Kellaway as Matthews, and a young Nancy Davis Reagan in the art gallery.<br /><br />Joseph Cotten is an engaging narrator, and his growing dependence on Jennie and his depression over Jennie's long absences is utterly believable (if a bit melodramatic). Jennifer Jones has more to work with here than in her first Oscar-winning role as Bernadette, although seeing a well-proportioned twentysomething trying to portray prepubescent innocence was a little bit creepy (see: Judy Garland in [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically, so Jones was able to display a range of emotions, from a childhood crush to deeper musings on the nature of love and faith. Some of the secondary characters suffer from disappearing Irish accents; others shamelessly (sometimes woodenly) overact.<br /><br />The film follows several conventions of its time, and appears dated. The ""special effects"" are pretty standard; several scale models are used and a green tint is used for the final scenes. There are some beautifully dreamy shots of New York City, and the fabulous effect of having shots appear as though they were painted on canvas. The DVD transfer features some artifacts and print flaws. There are no extras to speak of. However, fans of time-travel romances [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]and [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] will enjoy Portrait of Jennie, although the strongest film of this genre is undoubtedly The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Despite its shortcomings, Portrait of Jennie is a pretty decent love story.",[],B0002KPHYC,B0002KPHYC,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205453498000,4,False
5.0,A haunting tale of love and the sea,"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, based on the novel by Josephine Leslie (as R.A. Dick) and screenplay by Philip Dunne, is the English Victorian tale of widowed Lucy Muir (Gene Tierney) and her young daughter Anna (Natalie Wood). Wood turns in a spirited performance as young Anna, although she is not given a great deal of screen time. Edna Best makes a charming companion for the isolated Lucy as her outspoken maid Martha. Lucy's meddling in-laws want to force Lucy and Anna to move to London, but Lucy is offended by their view that she is helpless and incapable of supporting herself and her daughter on her writing. Tierney brings a gravity to her role befitting the Victorian era, but tempers it with a playful, witty streak. Harrison is effective as the gruff sea captain with a heart of gold. The two strike up an amazing amount of chemistry despite the physical distance between the actors; instead, emotion is conveyed through glances and words.<br /><br />The two move to a cottage by the sea that's curiously affordable considering the great view, but Lucy soon finds out why. It's haunted by the ghost of Captain Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison), a cantankerous old salt who's overly fond of swearing and frightening off prospective buyers. Lucy, however, is very forward and independent for her era and refuses to be forced out of her new home in Gull Cottage, so the two reach a kind of truce.<br /><br />Lucy and Daniel soon strike up a deep friendship bordering on romance, and Lucy, a writer, agrees to ghost write Capt Gregg's autobiography. During her meetings with the publisher, she is charmed by Miles Fairley (George Sanders), a famous children's author, and Daniel reluctantly lets Lucy pursue a flesh-and-blood suitor. The ending (much-copied) may be one of the most romantic on film, and clearly inspired later time-travel romance [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]].<br /><br />The film is marked by beautiful cinematography, particularly of the sea (filmed at Carmel-by-the-Sea, Monterey, and various other California coastal locations), and a lush, haunting score by Bernard Herrmann ([[ASIN:B000001527 The Ghost And Mrs. Muir: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]) that may be one of the most poetic film scores ever along with John Barry's [[ASIN:B00000AFYL Somewhere In Time (1998 Re-recording)]].<br /><br />The DVD thankfully features many fine extras, such as commentaries by film historian Gregg Kimble and Bernard Herrmann expert Christopher Husted, commentary by chairman of film studies at Wesleyan University Jeanine Bassinger and Kenneth Geist (biographer of Joseph L. Mackiewicz), A&E Biography:""Rex Harrison: The Man Who Would Be King,"" the original theatrical trailer, and a still gallery. This is a fitting tribute to one of the most timeless screen romances, and fans of [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] will feel right at home.",[],B000083C6R,B000083C6R,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205453339000,0,False
5.0,A bittersweet romance and a beautiful travelogue of Rome,"Roman Holiday is a beautifully bittersweet romance starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck (originally, it was optioned by Frank Capra, who had hoped to cast Cary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor in the lead roles). Hepburn plays the spoiled Princess Ann, who is fed up with palace life and the endless protocol. After being given a sedative, she makes a run for it and ends up out cold on a park bench in Rome, where newspaper man Joe Bradley discovers her and begrudgingly takes her home with him, fearing for her safety.<br /><br />He quickly pieces together her formal, outdated manner of speaking and the disappearance of the princess (official reason: sudden illness), and his first inclination is to cash in on her secret identity by writing a tell-all story for $5000. He enlists his friend Irving as photographer. But as Joe indulges Ann's simple wishes for gelato, sightseeing, and a dash of adventure, he finds himself genuinely falling for Ann. The two engage in a complicated tango of avoidance; Joe hides the fact that he's press, and Ann tells him that she's run away from school. Irving uses a camera hidden in his lighter to snap impromptu photos. Poor Irving is tripped and spilled on by Joe in a none-too-subtle attempt to shut him up before he spills the beans on more than one occasion, and I felt bad for Irving's bewildered expression as Joe keeps taking him out.<br /><br />Pandemonium breaks out as the palace sends out secret police to retrieve Ann, and the film falls into near-slapstick in the final third at a barge dancehall. The ending is bittersweet yet appropriate, neither too much nor too little. Roman Holiday is a stunning vehicle for the luminous Audrey Hepburn, who won an Oscar for her performance, was the first comedy for Gregory Peck, and most of all, serves as a showcase for the timeless wonders of Rome. It was the first American film to be shot entirely in Italy (Paramount had frozen assets in Italy). Real Italian nobility and real international press corps were featured in the film. Most of the locations exist, and the colorful, authentic backgrounds and ethnic faces add a degree of authenticity that could never have been matched in a California studio.<br /><br />There are several extras including a documentary on the film's restoration, a stills gallery, and the original trailer. The transfer is crisp enough and looks fresh despite its age. Roman Holiday will appeal to fans of romance, comedy, and travelogues, and is a mesmerizing blend of all three elements.",[],B00003CXCD,B00003CXCD,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1205452868000,1,False
5.0,Another hilarious sendup from the pleasantly warped Paul Gross,"Mention Paul Gross to an American, and the image that most people come up with is the uberpolite, by-the-book Mountie Benton Fraser from the Canadian series ""[[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]]"". Paul's dark, quirky humor still managed to surface through Frasier's naive act, particularly in the final seasons of the show. Now ask a Canadian; no doubt some will bring up [[ASIN:B00092ZSYM H2O]], a Canadian political thriller in which Gross plays the prime minister. Odds are, another Canadian will bring up [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]], Paul's directorial debut and attempt at a quintessential (if not the only) Canadian curling comedy. Next, ask a loyal Stratford theatre buff about Paul; no doubt that you'll hear of his brilliant performances as Hamlet in 2000. Paul is also a vocal advocate of the arts within Canada and an accomplished musician.<br /><br />Paul's many talents truly come together on Slings and Arrows, a sendup of the internationally-known Stratford Shakespeare Festival. For those not in the know, Stratford, Ontario (named after Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-Upon-Avon) hosts a lavish Shakespearian theater festival that runs for seven months a year, featuring some of the brightest stars of stage and screen.<br /><br />Slings and Arrows is titled after Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1) and is set in fictional New Burbage, a small, rural town that briefly flowers during tourist season. The New Burbage theater company is worn and uninspired, anchored by diva Ellen Fanshaw (played by Paul Gross's wife, Martha Burns). The artistic director Oliver Wells (Steven Ouimette) is a washed-up thespian and alcoholic who views the theater as a cash cow, nothing more. Across town, Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross) is struggling to save a small theater (Theatre Sans Argent, or ""Theater Without Money"") from eviction. Tennant suffered a mental breakdown seven years ago during one of Wells' productions of Hamlet, and it ended his career in the theater. On the opening night of A Midsummer Night's Dream, a very drunk Oliver calls Geoffrey from a payphone, passes out in the street, and is run over by a truck. His ghost haunts Geoffrey, who has become the interim artistic director of the festival.<br /><br />Which is all...very Shakespearian in nature. The show is rich with irony, and I found myself frequently laughing at unexpected flashes of brilliance. Add to the mix the quirky cast of actors, backstage antics, and theater in-jokes, and you have an effervescent satire of theater and the state of the arts in Canada.<br /><br />There are subplots involving American corporate sponsors, pot, budding love interests, and old rivalries. The dialogue is witty, the editing airtight, and the rousing opening and closing singalongs (""Cheer Up, Hamlet!"" and ""Call the Understudy"") make this a blast. Add to the fact that many members of the cast and crew are theater vets (Burns, Gross, Ouimette, Susan Coyne, and William Hutt all performed at Stratford) and Canadian screen stars (Don McKellar, Sarah Polley, Rachael McAdams).<br /><br />Though the show is beloved by many who work in the theater, non-thespians will find Slings and Arrows equally engrossing. My ""theater"" background consists of working backstage on one or two high school plays and a visit to Stratford in 2002, and I absolutely loved Slings and Arrows for its blend of comedy, outstanding performances, razor-sharp dialogue, and glimpse at the backstage craziness and camaraderie. Extras include a trailer that's best left until after you've watched the first season, outtakes, production notes, cast filmographies, a list of the series' credits, and lyrics to ""Cheer Up Hamlet"" and ""Call the Understudy.""",[],B000FBFYKU,B000FBFYKU,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1190314243000,18,False

5.0,A fabulous transfer brings Ocean Girl back to life...,"Ocean Girl captivated my imagination for years. I taped the original broadcasts from the Disney Channel, bought the novelization, and the soundtrack CD (only available in Australia). Like many other young fans, I wanted to *be* Neri. This family-friendly sci-fi series lasted for four seasons and was later made into an animated series, but the first season will always be the most magical for me.<br /><br />Neri is the mysterious Ocean Girl. Orphaned for many years, she lives alone on a deserted island in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of northern Queensland, Australia. She is able to communicate telepathically with Jali, a humpback whale. When Jason and Brett, sons of a prominent marine biologist, come to live at ORCA, an underwater research colony located near Neri's island, they discover Neri (and Jali) and develop a deep friendship. Just as Jason and Brett are curious about Neri's life on the island, she is equally curious to learn about their world.<br /><br />The series was filmed on location in Port Douglas, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Daintree Rainforest, and the nature photography is stunning: sharp, vibrant colors bring Neri's island to life, with close-ups on unusual insects and plants. The video transfer looks fabulous - clean and crisp. The episodes are spread across two discs, with animated menus and short clips from each episode.  The season one soundtrack is a beautiful mix of ambient sounds (waves, birdsong) and New Age that holds up well as a standalone listening experience.<br /><br />The first season DVD set contains all 13 episodes.  Although this is an Australian release, it is Region 0, so it should play on your computer (for some reason, I have absolutely no problems playing it on my budget TV and DVD player). There are no extras other than an introduction from the two main stars, Marzena Godecki (Neri) and David Hoflin (Jason), and a commentary on the first and last episodes (I have not listened to it yet--I don't want it to spoil the magic).",[],B000LQISG6,B000LQISG6,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1171811774000,19,False
5.0,"Engaging fable about love, magic, and believing in yourself","Master filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki has long been famous for his beautiful animated films (including My Neighbour Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Spirited Away), and Howl's Moving Castle is no exception. Based on the book of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving castle follows Sophie on a quest to break the curse that's turned her into a 90-year-old woman. Miyazaki's heroines are always brave, resourceful, and intelligent, and Sophie, a quiet hatmaker who lives a drab existence working in her late father's shop, is no exception. When Sophie is involved with the mysterious wizard Howl, her life as she knows it changes forever as she struggles to break the curse that binds her, Howl, and the fire demon Calcifer.<br /><br />Miyazaki once again paints an idealized Europe of grand castles, stirring military parades, and and elegant Victorian fashions, but unlike his earlier, peaceful European-influenced town of Koriko in Kiki's Delivery Service, war is an all-too-real reality in Howl.<br /><br />The story is slow to develop, but ultimately captivating, although there were a few subplots that left me confused. Beautiful visuals, a European-influenced soundtrack (which, sadly, will not be distributed in North America), and a masterful story by legendary author Diana Wynne Jones makes Howl a crowd-pleaser that anime fans will enjoy.",[],B000CDGVOE,B000CDGVOE,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1142288163000,3,False
5.0,Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds is amazing 22 years later...,"Miyazaki Hayao's first big film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds was released in 1984. Based upon Miyazaki's manga, it follows the futuristic barren wasteland that Earth has become, ravaged by industrial toxins and radiation. Small pockets of civilization perch on the edge of the Sea of Decay, among them Nausicaa's Valley of the Winds, untouched by toxic mold spores. Nausicaa is a young princess with the ability to talk to animals and insects, using charms to keep them from destroying themselves and others. She is a fearless leader of her people, who wants to stop the bloodshed between warring factions and stop the murder of giant insects such as the Ohmu. Although altruistic, she possesses a dangerous, unpredictable rage. There is a prophecy in the land that a ""...a person clad in blue standing in a golden field  will find the bond between humanity and the earth, and lead the people to a pure land...""<br /><br />The Valley is threatened when a ship from neighbouring Pejite crashes and releases toxic mold spores, along with a much more dangerous foe: one of the Giant God Soldiers responsible for the Seven Days of Fire, in which the world was nearly destroyed by nuclear radiation. Nausicaa finds the princess of Pejite inside, chained and mortally wounded.<br /><br />The Valley is threatened by the appearance of Princess Kushana of Torumekia, who seizes power in a coup, killing Nausicaa's father. She seeks to resurrect the Giant God Soldier, whose nuclear weapons can destroy both enemies and the hordes of destructive insects that ravage the land. Nausicaa escapes, and must save her beloved valley from a stampede of enraged Ohmu...<br /><br />The story, visuals, music, and sheer creativity are simply amazing. This is one of Miyazaki's most original, moving efforts, and I've seen nearly all his films from Nausicaa to Howl's Moving Castle. His frequent lament on the destruction of nature is at its most poignant here, the small seeds of hope blossoming into renewal. Visuals are strongly drawn from medieval costumes and castles in the Valley, the ships look like something from Star Trek, and the insects gave me nightmares (and I thought the giant cockroaches in my office were scary (!). I hope to get my hands on a copy of the original manga (in Japanese) to read more fully into the lush backstory of Nausicaa. Poetic, spiritual, and unique, this is my favourite Miyazaki film.",[],B0001XAPZ6,B0001XAPZ6,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1141648100000,7,False
5.0,This film is an absolute charmer!,"Hayao Miyazaki's ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is based on a series of children's stories by Eiko Kadono. Kiki is a thirteen-year-old witch, and must go out into the world to begin her training. Her mother is also a witch, a vanishing breed. Kiki (Kirsten Dunst) and her black cat Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman) set out to find a town to call their very own. After a disheartening evening of meeting up with a snooty witch-in-training and getting caught flying in a thunderstorm, the pair wakes up to a sunny day and new adventures.<br /><br />Kiki finds herself in Koriko, a beautiful seaside city modeled after Europe's genteel capitals, and in the capable, grateful hands of Osono, a pregnant baker. Her new talent seems to be delivering items on her broomstick, and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" is born. Kiki and Jiji take up lodgings at the bakery and soon are delivering every sort of item imaginable, from fish pies to stuffed cats to heavy boxes, and naturally, get into scrapes along the way. Young Jeff is fascinated by Kiki and her ability to fly (he is in a young pilots' club), and the two begin a bashful courtship of sorts. But one day, Kiki finds that her magical powers are fading--she can no longer fly or talk to Jiji....<br /><br />Many of Miyazaki's films feature strong female heroines, and Kiki is no exception. From Kiki's mother mixing potions, to Osono's successful bakery, to Ursula's career as a female artist and Kiki's own quest for independence, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" promotes a message of ""girl power"" and believing in oneself that makes it a good role model for young girls. Part of Kiki's charm is her awkwardness at becoming a teenager, and her magical troubles stem from self-doubt that, when corrected, finds her in flying form once again.<br /><br />Beautiful artwork, an old world musical score full of Parisian accordion and European charm, and a timeless story are enhanced by Disney's choice of A-list actors for the English dub (Kirsten Dunst, Phil Hartman, Janeane Garofalo). DVD comes in English, Spanish, and the original Japanese dub (with two choices of subtitles: the literal translation and the captions used in the English version), along with several extras (original Japanese trailers, ""Behind the Microphone"" with John Lasseter).",[],B00005JM2O,B00005JM2O,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1141333128000,4,False
5.0,Yamada Family Values,"This quirky comic strip family is lovingly brought to life in Houhokekyo tonari no Yamada-kun (My Neighbors the Yamadas). Mom (Matsuko), Dad (Takashi), Grandma (Shige), Noboru and Nonoko, and family dog Pochi are presented in a series of vignettes, from Matsuko and Takashi's wedding (complete with a dream sequence comparing marriage to a bobsled run and being tossed on stormy seas), to a forgetful day (blame the ginger!), to a hilarious nighttime encounter with motorcycle punks. The animation style is very low-key, taking its visual cues from pen-and-ink comics and a pastel wash. Less is more, as the mere outline of shoji screens and sakura (cherry blossoms) suffices to paint a minimalist picture of modern Japan. Poetry by Basho rounds out each clip. This is a wonderful introduction to Japanese culture, from proper dining etiquette (DON'T dump your rice into your soup :-), to Japanese homes (noren, airing out futons, place settings, traditional food such as miso, tamago, and tempura, changing into slippers when entering homes) wedding ceremonies, and more.<br /><br /> Some reviewers have mentioned that the stories lack cohesiveness, but I greatly enjoyed this unusual portrait of family life that looked at parent-child relations, marriage, salarymen, and the power of imagination. Although Disney dubbed this with an all-star cast (James Belushi, David Ogden Stiers), I didn't listen to the English dub, so I can't comment on the English cast (I prefer to view anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles to practice my Japanese listening comprehension). A vast departure from other Takahata Isao films (like Grave of the Fireflies), but an enjoyable one nonetheless, particularly if you are already familiar with elements of Japanese culture.",[],B0009MAO3M,B0009MAO3M,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1140723755000,20,False
5.0,Haunting masterpiece of the human cost of war,"""Hotaru no haka"" (Grave of the Fireflies) was directed by Takahata Isao, longtime colleague and collaborator of Miyazaki Hayao. The story is partially based on the autobiography of Nosaka Akiyuki. Produced by Studio Ghibli, ""Grave of the Fireflies"" follows the wartime journey of Seita and Setsuko, brother and sister, as they struggle to survive in postwar Kobe.<br /><br />The film begins with a voiceover by an eerie red spirit, and the sense of melancholy and foreboding continues throughout the film. The firebombing of Kobe is awesome to behold in its absolute destruction and scale; we see the wooden buildings burn like matchsticks. Ash and debris choke the air as more of the firebombs fall from the sky like clusters of bright flowers before they explode into fireballs that are all-consuming. Seita grabs Setsuko and runs through the blazing streets. The children do find their mother at a nearby triage center set up in a school, but are forced to go live with a stingy aunt in the countryside, who constantly nags Seita to do more for the war effort. Seita and his sister eventually set off on their own, where they dream of happier days with their parents as food becomes more and more scarce.<br /><br />Although an animated film, this was the most powerful messenger of the horrors of war that I have ever experienced, as powerful as Schindler's List. Animation provides the means to portray the utter destruction with an objective, stylized eye; the charred bodies and burned-out shells of buildings, the horribly burned and maimed victims, the striking contrast of the soft green luxuriousness of the Japanese countryside, with its rice paddies and traditional architecture. There is an amazing attention to detail, from the prints of kimonos to the detailed porcelain rice bowls, that makes the animation incredibly lifelike, and at the same time, free from constraints of traditional filmmaking. The film captures humanity on a grand scale: the tearful reuniting of a mother and daughter at a local train station even as Seita must deceive Setsuko that their parents will come along soon to collect them, Seita's beating at the hands of a local farmer, the glad homecoming of affluent daughters across a valley where Seita is weighed down by grief and destitution, and Seita's tender care of his weakened little sister, with her sunny smiles and childhood innocence even at the darkest moments.<br /><br />Although animated, this is clearly a film for adults and teenagers, not children. The level of violence (in the firebombing raids and beatings) and tragedy makes this too overwhelming for young children, but for the rest of us, it is a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and the power of love. A masterpiece of filmmaking in any medium, and one of the most gripping, brutally honest portrayals of the toll of modern warfare on the most vulnerable: the children.",[],B00006HAWP,B00006HAWP,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1140699109000,2,False

David Marciano (Ray) was replaced by Canadian tough guy Callum Keith Rennie from Hard Core Logo. Marciano's absence was explained by having him on an undercover drug bust in Mexico, and Callum was a stand-in as Ray. Paul Gross took on the triple hats of actor, director, and producer, as well as doing most of his own stunts. And the show took a much darker, gritter, sexually charged tone in its final reincarnation. Citing reading Due South slash fiction (homoerotic fan fiction), Gross included elements (real or implied, your call) of homoerotic tension between Kowalski and Fraser, more violence, explicit songs on the soundtrack, and a less family friendly tone in general. My greatest disappointment was with the series finale, in which the storylines are wrapped up in an improbable, flippant way that insulted fans of the first two seasons. Et tu, Benton?<br /><br />Hardcore fans will want the third season (originally split into two seasons in the US), but the best episodes are in the first two seasons with the ""real"" Ray.

(My favourite surreal moment is in ""The Man Who Knew Too Little,"" where they are supposedly in Michigan [the highway markers are distinctively Ontarian] and mention the town where I grew up).<br /><br />Although the picture quality is less than stellar, it certainly beats my old videotaped copies that were rapidly deteriorating, and it's wonderful to reconnect with the excellent scripts, jokes, and friendly jabs at Canadian culture (curling, hockey, bilingualism, politeness, etc.). The first two seasons are very family friendly, with limited swearing, violence, and sexual overtones. The third (and fourth, depending on how you count the last season) season was much darker, grittier, and sexually charged, including explicit songs on the soundtrack, and may not be as suitable for family viewing.",[],B000A0GY0K,B000A0GY0K,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1137331943000,12,True
5.0,Relive the magic of one of TV's most unique sci-fi series,"""SeaQuest DSV"" originally aired in 1993 (I was in junior high at the time). A futuristic show set in the mid-21st century, it followed the adventures of the SeaQuest, a peacekeeping/ research submarine, and its crew, headed by Nathan Bridger (Roy Scheider from Jaws). Much like Star Trek, SeaQuest was devoted to the exploration of unknown worlds in the form of the mysteries of the ocean: black smokers and toxic bacteria, mysterious minerals on the ocean floor, and battling new viruses. The crew was also called to rescue missions and to defuse hostile situations between various factions.<br /><br />The first season was by far the best. Although elements of the supernatural and extraterrestrial were explored, it was done in a scientific, believable manner. Seasons two and three (dubbed ""Voyage to the bottom of the barrel"" by some critics) degenerated into a Xena-like world of Greek gods, giant robots, and aliens that had little to do with the dignity and wonder of the first season. The futuristic military and scientific technology was always believable, grounded in modern design and aesthetically beautiful (look at how much background detail is in the SeaQuest sets).<br /><br />The cast, headed by Roy Scheider, was a tightly-knit ensemble that was always believable as a military family: there were rivalries, outbursts, and crew romances,  but they all came together in times of need. First season standouts in addition to those above include Lieutenant Commander Katherine Hitchcock (Stacy Haiduk), Dr. Kristin Westphalen (Stephanie Beacham), resident linguist Tim O'Neill (Ted Raimi from Xena Warrior Princess, brother of Spiderman director Sam Raimi), and teenage prodigy Lucas Wolenczak (Jonathan Brandis, who committed suicide in 2003). Notable guest stars include William Shatner, Charlton Heston, and Seth Green. The show was fairly unique for the time in that multiethnic characters played major roles onboard the SeaQuest (Commander Jonathan Ford (Don Franklin) and Sensor Chief Miguel Ortiz (Marco Sanchez).<br /><br />Though the CGI special effects certainly appear dated thirteen years later, they were fairly advanced for the time (1993). The video quality on the DVD set is very good, much better than the original broadcasts. The soundtrack by John Debney brings to mind work by John Williams, and the show's writing (at least the first season) was a fine balance of humor, drama, and camaraderie that never felt stilted or forced.<br /><br />My collection has finally come full circle: I'm now the proud owner of the DVD set in addition to SeaQuest models, soundtrack, a T-shirt, all three paperbacks, a calendar, bookmark, and the video game. I'm so glad to finally own a DVD version of SeaQuest (I was left with disintegrating VHS tapes), and this version was worth the wait! The box design and cases are beautiful and functional. There are four two-sided discs housed in four slim cases listing each episode. Menus are very limited and give a brief summary for each episode, along with chapters. The only extra is half an hour of deleted scenes available for several episodes (filmed but not finished, no background music, etc., which explains the eerie silence) and closed captioning, but this is a beautiful tribute to one of my favourite TV series of all time.",[],B000BR9SA0,B000BR9SA0,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1137241543000,12,True
5.0,Family-friendly faithful adaptation of Esther Forbes' classic as good as I remember from childhood!,"As a child, I would go to Colonial Williamsburg nearly every year on school breaks. I adored anything having to do with colonial history, and fell in love with Johnny Tremain (book first, then movie) instantly. Esther Forbes' classic novel tells the rousing tale of a haughty Boston silversmith's apprentice, Johnny Tremain, who, when maimed in an accident with molten silver, gives up his apprenticeship, hits all new lows as he is turned down for jobs because of his deformed hand, and is accused of theft by one of Boston's elite. He matures from boy to man as he joins up with the Sons of Liberty and participates in the planning of the American Revolution (along with some of colonial Boston's most brilliant minds).<br /><br />Disney's 1957 film adaptation starring Hal Stalmaster was made for TV but also shown in theaters. The costumes, music, and sets are fairly convincing at portraying colonial Boston. The film, at 81 minutes, cuts out a lot of backstory regarding Johnny's inner process of maturation and changes a crucial plot point near the end (presumably to make the film more child-friendly), but generally remains faithful to the spirit of the original book. The transfer is generally very clean and crisp, amazing for a movie of this age.<br /><br />Amazingly, we actually saw an old reel copy of Johnny Tremain in my fifth grade class ( this was in the early 1990s), and until now, the only copy I owned was a disintegrating VHS tape that'd I'd recorded from the Disney Channel. The DVD release features wonderful extras: Walt Disney talking about the making of the film, and the introductions that were played with each part (the original film was divided into two episodes), basically shameless marketing for other Disney films and a Liberty Square theme park experiment that never came to fruition, but fascinating nonetheless that these extras were saved and presented with the film. The only disappointment is that the excellent animated short ""Ben and Me,"" about a mouse who shares a home with Benjamin Franklin, wasn't included (it's referenced in the two segments, but has never been released to DVD).<br /><br />A great little family film for history buffs and a real treat those who grew up on classic 1950's Disney live-action fare (Swamp Fox, Spin and Marty, Davy Crockett).",[],B00005JM6F,B00005JM6F,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1134965707000,13,False
4.0,Heartwarming tale of the power of music and love both real and perceived,"""Ladies in Lavender"" tells the tale of two elderly sisters, Ursula (Judi Dench) and Janet (Maggie Smith), who share an ancient cottage in Cornwall, England on the eve of WWII. One morning after a violent storm, they find a young man washed up on the beach, more dead than alive. They take him in and tend to him, quickly discovering that he speaks no English, but he speaks German and says he is Polish. The fact that he speaks German arouses local suspisions, as the villagers wonder if he could be a German spy.<br /><br />Time passes quickly, and Andrea (Spanish-German Daniel Bruhl, better known for 2003's Good Bye, Lenin!) quickly proves his talent with the violin. Matters are complicated when both of the sisters fall for Andrea. The tender, naive Ursula seems to have never had a beau, and despite the great age difference between her and Andrea, clearly is pondering a sexual relationship with him. Janet tries to rein her in, to no effect.<br /><br />A mysterious, beautiful stranger named Olga is also a newcomer to the village. Although she, too, speaks German (and French), she is Russian, sister of the famous violin virtuoso Boris Danilof. This important information is withheld from Andrea, as the sisters strive to keep him for themselves, but Andrea is miserable at having his career as a concert violinist kept at arm's length. He begins to spend more and more time with Olga, to the distaste of Ursula and Janet, and in a fateful conversation, he is told of Olga's identity and of her famous brother, who wants to meet Andrea. His conscience torments him at having to make the choice between leaving the kind-hearted sisters and seizing his rightful place in the concert halls of the world.<br /><br />Ursula's childish love affair with Andrea is heartbreaking. She asks Janet about her dead beau several times, asking ""if you really loved him."" Janet catches Ursula in Andrea's room at night, touching him while he is asleep. And in a brief dream sequence, we see Ursula as a young woman, rolling about in the fields with Andrea. She is so fragile, so naive, and heartbroken when Andrea ultimately makes his choice, that Judi Dench's performance can be hard to watch in these scenes.<br /><br />Beautiful cinematography of Cornwall, a gorgeous soundtrack with virtuoso Joshua Bell, two legends of British theater, and a strong supporting cast makes ""Ladies in Lavender"" another example of why British cinema is some of the best out there. Fans of ""The Red Violin"" and musical/historical dramas will do well to check out ""Ladies in Lavender.""",[],B000BITVAG,B000BITVAG,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1134564564000,66,False
5.0,Haunting true-life drama of abandonment and the resilience of children,"""Dare mo shiranai"" (Nobody Knows) by Kore-eda Hirokazu is all the more poignant for being based on a real-life scandal in Japan. In 1988, four children were found abandoned by their mother, living for six months in a squalid Tokyo apartment with no running water, electricity, or food, where one of the children, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed.<br /><br />As the film begins, the family is moving into yet another apartment; they are continuously evicted for having too many children. The two youngest children arrive smuggled in suitcases, already a sign of the startling neglect to come, as the mother portrays this as a game. The hot, tired children unfold from their suitcase prisons as the mother laughs, claps her hands and tells them ""Good job!"" in her Minnie Mouse voice. The children's flighty mother is barely more than a child herself, unable to cope with real life and care for her large brood (each child has a different father).<br /><br />It is never explicitly stated what her job is, but she frequently leaves the children for long stretches of time, expecting eldest son Akira (Yuya Yagira) to care for ten-year-old Kyoko, seven-year-old Shigeru, and five-year-old Yuki. The children are like children everywhere: they long to play outside, be rambunctious, play in the park, be free to dream. Instead, they are virtual prisoners, unable to leave the apartment lest they be caught. Even the small balcony is off limits. Akira does all of the outside shopping, bill paying, and cooking. None of the children go to school. ""Why do you want to go to school?"" their mother asks. ""Famous people don't go to school."" Like who? Akira demands. His mother can't come up with a suitable answer.<br /><br />The inevitable happens: their mother is infatuated with the latest boyfriend, and skips town for good. Akira holds off telling the other children for as long as possible; after all, their mother is frequently gone for months at a time. He is forced to spend down, but it isn't enough. The utilities are eventually cut off, and the apartment descends into a pit of hell, with garbage covering everything. The children must use the bathroom in the park and wash their clothes in a fountain, and survive off of leftover sushi handouts. Akira falls in with a group of thug-like high schoolers who use him, taunt him, and try to get him to shoplift, and the youngest children suffer the most. Somber Kyoko taps out melodies on her toy piano, Shigeru breaks the rules by running wild outside, and Yuki colors and draws pictures that cover every inch of the apartment. Their situation becomes more and more dire; even though the landlord's wife has seen the state of the apartment, no social services are called in. The children are left to fester as their clothes unravel and they slowly succumb to malnutrition. An accident occurs, prompted out of boredom, that changes their close-knit lives. The ending is sparse, haunting, and we are not told what becomes of the children, or if their mother was ever found.<br /><br />The child actors were essentially filmed living in the apartment throughout an entire year of filming, so in some ways, ""Nobody Knows"" plays out like a documentary. The scene where they play in the park for the first time was really their first time leaving the apartment in months. It is heartwrenching to watch them spying on ""normal"" children down below, children who take school for granted, are allowed to ride bikes and play in the park. There is no creative outlet, no exercise, no nourishing food, and yet, although weakened, their spirits still demonstrate the resilience of childhood. Kore-eda's haunting portrait of solitude and survival at its darkest is difficult to watch, but worth the journey.",[],B000A5044C,B000A5044C,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1134046020000,6,False
3.0,Could have been so much more....,"""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is based upon the novel of the same name, a tale of female friendships withstanding the ups and downs of a segregated South, WWII, and battles with alcohol and prescription drug addiction. Vivi, Teensy, Necie, and Caro are the Ya Ya's, bonded in a midnight blood-swapping First Nations-inspired ceremony complete with headdresses and Ya Ya war chant. They slip into adolescence together, sharing first crushes, a night in jail over indecent exposure, and supporting each other through humiliation and loss.<br /><br />Siddalee, Vivi's adult daughter who happens to be a successful playwright in New York, says more than she intends to in an interview, and the offensive results are published in Time Magazine. When Vivi reads Sidda's confessions of her mother's beatings, alcoholism, and dark nature, she is outraged, writing Vivi out of her will and cutting her face out of all of the family photos. The remaining Ya-Yas (Maggie Smith, Fionnula Flanagan, Shirley Knight, Ellen Burstyn) come to the rescue by kidnapping Sidda and bringing her back to Louisiana to share with her the secrets of the Ya-Yas.<br /><br />The movie's most grievous flaw is playing up the material as a comedy. In the book, the elements of comedy serve to enlighten an otherwise dark, tragic tale of loss, abandonment, and abuse, but the film shoots itself in the foot by trying to elicit laughs.<br /><br />The casting is also suspect: although James Garner plays a strong, silent husband with a tender heart, the Ya-Ya actresses (one from England, one from Ireland) never seemed authentically ""Southern,"" most times looking lost, and frequently slipping into their native accents. For once, could someone cast Southern women as Southern women, please? Ashley Judd is luminous as the young Vivi, but bears nothing in common resemblance-wise with Ellen Burstyn, who plays older Vivi. Sandra Bullock is a restrained Sidda, much more earthbound than the zany, alcohol-sodden Ya-Yas (the scene with Sidda and the Ya-Yas in the restaurant was just painful--Note to producers: it is NOT funny drugging someone with a date rape drug).<br /><br />The original novel, at over 300 pages, has been cut down to a two-hour film, but in doing so, eliminates important subplots (Vivi's confinement and near-death illness in a nightmarish Catholic school as punishment from her hatred-filled, obsessively French Catholic mother) and changes others (Sidda's elephant ride becomes a plane ride). Willetta's mistreatment at the hands of rich, pro-Civil War relatives (calling her the n-word, making her wear a maid's uniform) forces young Sidda to see for the first time that Willetta has a family and feelings, too, but the scene is cut short in an attempt to play it up as comedy (a food fight at the table). The book's original explanation behind Shep planting sunflowers for Vivi is never explored, so the film's touching symbolism of sunflowers (on Sidda's warbonnet, the film's poster) is never explained and doesn't make sense for those that haven't read the book.<br /><br />The soundtrack by T Bone Burnett (the man behind O Brother Where Art Thou) is worth purchasing, as it combines Cajun, blues, gospel, and standards by a variety of artists, capturing the feel of the post-WWII South, but the DVD should be a rental. Extras include a behind-the-scenes featurette, trailer, and scrapbook. This will appeal to fans of the original book, but may not make much sense to everyone else because of the massive plot trimming.",[],B00005JLCT,B00005JLCT,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1133614555000,4,False
5.0,The best documentary of the year...inspiring and energizing,"""Murderball"" is the rough-and-tumble world of U.S. Wheelchair Quad Rugby, a sport with essentially tank-like wheelchairs, a ball, male pride, and a whole lot of youthful testosterone and adrenaline. There are no helmets, no shin guards, only speed, determination, and how hard you can slam your chair into your opponent to make them give up the ball/slow them down.<br /><br />The documentary traces the players of Team USA: Mark Zupan, Keith Cavill, Andy Cohn, Scott Hogsett, and Bob Lujano, on their quest to capture the gold medal at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. In a parallel storyline, former quad rugby star Joe Soares has jumped ship and is coaching Team Canada, leading to a bitter rivalry between the two teams.<br /><br />""Murderball"" is fast-paced and furious, with loads of on-the-court wheel-cam action, a great soundtrack (I loved the haunting cello theme), tight editing, and fun moments just hanging out with Team USA to witness pranks, parties, and pick-up lines. There is graphic talk of sex as a quadriplegic, the frustrations of physical rehab and life after injury, old wounds reopened, a medical emergency, and a look at baby-faced Iraq War vets with missing limbs (they looked about fifteen) at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Part of what makes ""Murderball"" so effective as a documentary is its laid-back approach to interviews and capturing candid moments. The players aren't made out to be heroes or saints; only as human as the rest of us. Inspiring, dramatic, and a worthy tribute to the formidable Team USA.<br /><br />The DVD contains a Larry King interview, Johnny Knoxville Murderball special with Mark Zupan, a featurette, interview with Joe Soares, deleted scenes, filmmaker commentary, player commentary, an update on Keith's chair, and more. (Contains sexually explicit dialogue, alcohol use and adult language).",[],B000B5XP24,B000B5XP24,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1133492245000,2,False
5.0,"A stunning, visionary debut that evokes the glory years of the serials","""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" was Kerry Conran's one-man homage (the original six-minute short, included as an extra, was made on a Mac in his apartment, no less) to the sci-fi film serials of the 1930s and 40s, replete with snappy, sultry reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) in search of the ultimate scoop, cocky fighter pilot Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), the over-eager, clean-cut techno-whiz kid sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), and feisty, no-nonsense ex-flame Frankie (Angelina Jolie), commander of an airborne British squadron. I thought the actors did a wonderful job, especially when you consider that there were no sets, props, etc. to set the stage, so to speak.<br /><br />The film was completely created via CGI, and takes viewers from the Art Deco lines of New York to the gardens of Shangri-la on a quest to discover why giant robots are attacking cities around the globe. This is a film of unprecedented beauty, filled to the brim with every child's thrills: dinosaurs, robots, ray guns, dirigibles, rockets, airborne battles, and more, with a dash of romance and intrigue for the grownups. It's even more amazing watching the two-part documentary Brave New World, in which we see the soundstages and blue screens, completely devoid of props, etc. except for the actors and their marks. The costumes, music, and filmmaking lovingly recall the 1930s and 1940s, from the film titles to the sweeping orchestral themes. An experience not to be missed for fans of vintage sci-fi the gloriously cheesy sci-fi serials of decades past.",[],B0006IIPIK,B0006IIPIK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1132871321000,5,False
5.0,The complete Savage Garden experience on DVD,"Taken from the Brisbane concert on the Affirmation World Tour of 2000, ""Superstars and Cannonballs"" captures the amazing energy of Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones onstage as well as behind-the-scenes. The very complete concert portion features a mix of songs from Savage Garden (Break Me Shake Me, I Want You, Santa Monica, To The Moon And Back, Truly Madly Deeply) and Affirmation (The Best Thing, The Lover After Me, Hold Me, Two Beds and a Coffee Machine, Crash and Burn, You Can Still Be Free, The Animal Song, Gunning Down Romance, Chained To You, I Knew I Loved You, Affirmation), clocking in at a hefty 110 minutes. The concert can be played all the way through or you can select individual songs.<br /><br />Also included is the band's commentary, displayed via a pop-up window in the lower right-hand corner of the screen regarding their feelings on the new songs from Affirmation, three music videos (two studio versions of Crash and Burn and I Knew I Loved You and a concert montage of Affirmation), several multi-angle songs, a discography, and the intriguing documentary ""Parallel Lives"" that traces Savage Garden's roots in Brisbane (Darren revisits his childhood home with original carpet and fence), life on the road, the price of fame, and silly moments with the band. We see Darren at press conferences and meet and greets, and it's clear from both Darren and Daniel how much their fans mean to them personally and not just as (Australian) dollar signs.<br /><br />Special mention goes to the awesome title menu. So often, boring, static backgrounds are used, but there is a minute-long animation of fascinating imagery (Russian religious icons, tribal sculptures, botanical prints) that introduces the DVD and the concert itself. The concert is beautifully photographed as well, with the mind-boggling lighting and special effects.

4.0,"A monumental orgy of drugs, drink, sex and music. ""Who wants to *&#*n party ?!?""","""It's all gone Pete Tong"" is Cockney rhyming slang for ""It's all gone wrong,"" named after British DJ Pete Tong (who appears in the film and is a producer). This mockumentary by Canadian Michael Dowse (Fubar) follows the rise, fall, and resurrection of Frankie Wilde (Paul Kaye), a resident Ibiza god of the turntables who has the club crowd drooling at his feet. Frankie is losing his hearing due to a combination of drugs, working the clubs, and a congenital hearing defect, and instead of heeding his doctor's advice, he drowns in more booze, more coke, and self-destructive behaviour. In a studio blowout, he loses the rest of his hearing and becomes a drug-addled hermit. Finally kicking the drug habit and pulling himself together after two failed suicide attempts, Frankie seeks out a lip reading teacher and discovers how to beat mix using vibrations.<br /><br />As many have noted, this is a film that walks a very narrow line between humour and mock-seriousness in the style of ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" with the prerequisite talking-head interviews with real-life DJ celebs, including Tiesto, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Sarah Main, and more. The problem is, ""Pete Tong"" can't decide if it's a mockumentary biopic, rave epic, or love story, and loses its cohesion along the way. Much of it is played up for shock value, with excessive amounts of projectile vomiting, graphic sex, drug use and filthy language. The Coke Badger wasn't funny at all: a six-foot stuffed badger wearing a dirty apron, complete with dangling white snot, chases Frankie to snort more coke.<br /><br />Where ""Pete Tong"" does shine is in its soundtrack (available as ASIN: B00097HDOU) and its club scenes, shot inside the legendary Ibiza palaces of Cream, Amnesia, and Manumission during actual theme nights at full capacity of 10,000. The ""interviews"" with ethnic tourists (Spanish transvestite, Polish flower seller, German guys) and on-location photography of restaurants, villas, and clubs really lend the film an authentic feel. The behind-the-scenes making of, which clocks in at almost an hour, details the grueling shoot that almost didn't happen: no money, no line producer, no extras, no cars, no water, etc. Another nice extra are the featurettes that were originally available on several websites to promote the film. These don't tie directly into the story, but serve to flesh out the characters.<br /><br />This is NOT for sensitive viewers, but when all is said and done, I'm glad I finally had the chance to see Frankie in action after waiting since the film's release last April. Fans of rave, house, techno, and Ibiza veterans will have fun with this.",[],B000A7LR6Y,B000A7LR6Y,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1132360975000,8,False
5.0,A haunting look at the struggle for survival in the Jewish Ghetto,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" tracks the incredible struggle for survival of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist in 1930s Warsaw. As the film opens, Wladyslaw is recording on Polish radio, but a bombing raid forces him out of the studio and into the panicked streets. We soon meet his family: a headstrong brother, gentle sisters, and aged parents who are aghast at the more and more extreme measures taken to dehumanize Polish Jews: wearing armbands, not allowed to walk on sidewalks, not allowed to sit on benches in public parks or eat in Gentile establishments, and finally, the move to the Ghetto. Wladyslaw's tight-knit family struggles to stay together as conditions become more and more dire.<br /><br />The film traces the disintegration of order in Warsaw from 1939 to 1945. Wladyslaw's life goes to new lows as the Ghetto is evacuated to the work (death) camps, and he must go into hiding, his situation becoming more and more dire as he is forced to flee from place to place and scrabble for food. He is taken advantage of, nearly dies from jaundice, and is nearly killed several times, but throughout the music in his head, heart and fingertips still burns brightly. Towards the end of the war, a single act of kindness by a Nazi commander proves that there is still decency in humanity, and finally Wladyslaw is once more able to give the world his musical gift over Polish radio.<br /><br />This film, while perhaps not on the same level as Schindler's list (there is very little dialogue for much of the film, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it becomes an almost Cast Away tale of solitary survival at its rawest), highlights the indignities perpetrated against European Jews. Dead bodies litter the streets, and the Nazis indiscriminately kill or humiliate whoever they so desire. Human dignity has no worth. The film's violence serves to underscore how much like animals humans can become, filled with primitive blood lust, or like the Jews in the Ghetto, forced to survive on an animal level: an old man attacks an old woman to steal her food, and as the mush splashes on the filthy pavement, he hungrily stuffs it into his mouth off the ground. This is powerful filmmaking, based in part on some of Polanski's own remembrances. (Rated R for graphic violence).",[],B000092Q7O,B000092Q7O,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1132233179000,3,False
5.0,A family's love is tested by changing times,"Barry Levinson's sprawling ""Avalon"" tells the story of Polish Jewish immigrant Sam Krichinsky as he joins his four brothers in Baltimore, 1914. The movie opens with a beautifully shot montage of fireworks, American symbols of liberty such as the eagle, and an immigrant's wonder at the lights and joy surrounding him on the Fourth of July. We cut to the present, where Sam's large family is introduced at Thanksgiving dinner, where the various brothers and their wives bicker in the way that large families do. Sam's son, Jules (Aidan Quinn), and his grandson Michael (Elijah Wood, in his first major role) become the focus of much of the story. Sam and his cousin Izzy (Kevin Pollack) engage in a series of risky business deals to expand their small department store into televisions, then a discount store, then a discount warehouse, all the while swept along by the tide of modern technology (television).<br /><br />Levinson based the character of Sam on his own immigrant grandfather, and Avalon paints a poignant portrait of family dynamics and the intrusion of commercialism and technology on their lives. Avalon feels like it could have benefited from a little extra trimming (the subplot of Eva's long-lost brother coming to America fades in and out in the blink of an eye), but overall was a beautiful look at a family's changing traditions across the generations. Armin Mueller-Stahl is amazing as Sam, and Joan Plowright as his long-suffering wife brings a fire and charm to the character that reminded me of my own Polish grandmother.<br /><br />The one element that seemed too transparent was the family's Jewishness, or lack of it. We never see the Krichinsky family at seders, Shabbat, Hanukkah, or other holidays, which seems in a way to strip them of the freedom sought in America (there is some Yiddish spoken, we do hear that Eva's brother was in a concentration camp, and see a Jewish cemetery, but that's about it). The next generations become more and more Americanized, changing their names. Kudos for the excellent period music (1940s Big Band and swing, jazz) and vintage television serials, costumes, and cinematography. This is a beautiful film that embraces family and tradition in turbulent times.",[],B000056HP4,B000056HP4,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1132067626000,34,False
5.0,"My first memories of holiday movies, and still my favourite...relive the timeless magic","As a child, I remember my mother watching this on TV every year. When I was slightly older, I became wrapped up in the magic of ""A Christmas Carol,"" and would eagerly await this version on AMC every year. I never understood why Alastair Sims' 1951 version was heralded as the ultimate version; for me, it was too contrived, too melodramatic, and Sims chews up the scenery.<br /><br />This 1938 version is a warmhearted take on Dickens' classic tale of greed and redemption. Bob Crachit's family is given a greater role than in the original novel, and the strength of the ensemble cast shines. Reginald Owen as Scrooge was a last-minute replacement, since Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter in ""It's a Wonderful Life"") was ill. Gene and Kathleen Lockhart shine as the Cratchits (their daughter June made her debut in this), Terry Kilburn is a hyper but cute Tiny Tim, Barry McKay makes a dashing Fred, and Leo G. Carroll makes for a frightening Marley's ghost.<br /><br />The sets of wintertime London are charming and varied, the costumes lavish, and Franz Waxman's score perfectly accents tender scenes without overwhelming. This is the first time that the 1938 version is available on DVD (in its original glorious B&W and not the awful colorized version), and it includes several brief extras: the film's original theatrical trailer, 2 festive vintage featurettes: Jackie Cooper's Christmas Party and Judy Garland Sings ""Silent Night"" and the classic Oscar®-nominated cartoon Peace on Earth.

The DVD is divided into several sections: Dublin, The Best of South Ireland: Glendalough, Waterford, Kinsale and More, The Best of West Ireland: Dingle, Galway and the Aran Islands, Belfast and the Best of Northern Ireland, and a bonus interview (approximate runtime 2 hours).<br /><br />Rick provides a whirlwind overview of the main sights, including Trinity College, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and Guinness (Dublin), the Waterford factory, Rock of Cashel, the monastery at Glendalough, Powerscourt Gardens, Blarney Castle, Giants Causeway and Belfast. We hear from charming local guides talking about Irish customs, and see Rick and family chipping in with drying hay (Aran Islands), see peat stacked to dry, and how farmers create movable gates in stone walls. Rick talks to a guide at a 13th-century lighthouse (one of the oldest in Europe), listens in on native Irish Gaelic speakers chatting with each other, boards a replica of a famine ship complete with costumed actors, and drives across Ireland with his wife Anne and two children, Andy and Jackie, in tow (his son Andy is currently blogging his way across Europe on a backpacking trip). He serves as a very down-to-earth guide, and offers several off-the-beaten path dining and boarding suggestions. I am planning on taking Rick's ""Best of Ireland"" tour next year, and this was a great introduction to what awaits.<br /><br />Kudos for the beautiful cinematography (lots of aerial footage of the Cliffs of Moher and Ring of Kerry) and authentic Irish background music -- with one or two exceptions, there was none of the horrible canned pseudo-Irish synth music that graces so many travel DVDs. For more info, check out Rick's travel guide on Ireland (Rick Steves' Ireland 2006, ISBN: 1566917263), with plenty more unusual sights, sounds, and tastes that bring you the best of Ireland in a laid-back, local flavour.",[],B00064ALJ0,B00064ALJ0,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1131459528000,13,False
4.0,"""Matchmaker, Matchmaker, make me a match...""","""The Matchmaker"" is a charming comedy set in rural Ireland and starring an unlikely heroine: Janeane Garofalo, better known as a stand-up comedienne who's worked with Ben Stiller, SNL, and Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion. Janeane stars as Marcy Tizard, harried assistant to Senator John McGlory in the middle of his reelection campaign. The campaign isn't going well, and McGlory and his chauvinistic, power-hungry handler Nick (Denis Leary) send Marcy to Ballinagra, Ireland to look up the senator's Irish roots in a bid to connect with Irish-American voters.<br /><br />Marcy arrives in the middle of the town's matchmaking festival, where every male wants nothing more than to propose, from the dashingly handsome to the decrepit. Getting information from the locals is more of a challenge than she'd realized. The small village is full of colourful characters, and Marcy becomes attached to Sean (David O'Hara), a former journalist who's dead-ended himself as bartender. The charming Milo O'Shea as the town's matchmaker brought to mind David Kelly in ""Waking Ned Devine.""<br /><br />The scenery of the rugged Irish coast (Cliffs of Moher) and Aran Isles (one of the last bastions of Irish Gaelic, as evidenced by Irish-language signs and greetings) and the rollicking Irish score, with contributions by Van Morrison, the Chieftains, Waterboys, and more, will appeal to lovers of Celtic lore, unusual romances, and low-key comedies.  I was pleasantly surprised by the charming sum of its parts, although I could have done with a little less of the smarmy politics, given the current political atmosphere and media saturation it receives.

4.0,"What women wanted: the 1950s ""happy housewife"" breaks free","""Mona Lisa Smile"" follows Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts), a progressive, feminist art teacher as she travels from California to Wellesley in 1953 to accept her dream job as an art history professor. Wellesley is an exclusive girls' school, home to well-bred, wealthy young women whose sole purpose after college (often during) is to get married, have babies, and be the perfect mother and housewife. Katherine is quickly frustrated by the stifling traditional atmosphere.<br /><br />On the first day of class, Katherine is humiliated when all of the students have memorized the art history textbook, quickly making a shambles of her first lesson. Shaken, Katherine calls her boyfriend in tears. The girls are rude, conceited, and have no intent to challenge themselves, which is where Katherine draws the line. Ever the trooper, she marches back to the next class with slides of modern art, making the girls think outside the textbook on the nature of art.<br /><br />The rest of the film follows Katherine as she attempts to fight the Stepford Wives system: the girls spend time learning etiquette, poise, and elocution, place settings, and banter, but mostly hunting future husbands and having lavish weddings. Katherine soon locks horns with Betty (Kirsten Dunst), the most dangerous of the lot. Betty's backstabbing quickly sees to the firing of the school's lesbian nurse for distributing contraceptives, and tries to have Katherine fired as well. She is generally only good at bringing misery to those around her, failing to see her own shortcomings or her husband's infidelities.<br /><br />Katherine soon comes up against the opinions of the other professors, and is pursued by Bill Dunbar, the handsome Italian professor who sleeps with his students. To me, the romance felt forced: Katherine rejects a marriage proposal, and a woman as liberal and feminist as Katherine wouldn't be caught dead with the chauvinistic Bill. The camaraderie of several of the students (Joan, Giselle, and Connie) is shown throughout the year at different campus events, which serves to develop their characters and to see the difference that Katherine makes on their lives (Giselle aspires to be more like Katherine).<br /><br />Katherine soon is introducing ""dangerous, subversive"" feminist ideas by using propaganda (advertisements) of housewives to show the girls that throwing their education away for a happy home is a mistake. One of her students, Joan, is accepted to Yale Law School, but her decision and freedom is ultimately her own to decide.<br /><br />This was a better movie than I expected after reading several reviews. The period costumes and music really transported me to a simpler time. Julia Roberts' character was delightfully down to earth, and the many big-name young stars (Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal) fit seamlessly into the fabric of the early 1950s. The scenery of Wellesley College (filmed on location) reminded me strongly of my own campus (Michigan State with its Beaumont Tower). The film has moments of humor, but also darker moments of jealousy and spite that result in larger consequences (the firing of the school nurse, a broken relationship, a girl being thrown out of her home).<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras, namely three featurettes on College: Now and Then, Art History, and What Women Wanted: 1953, which all feature movie footage interspersed with interviews from cast and crew, a music video for Elton John's ""The Heart of Every Girl,"" and several movie trailers.",[],B0001ADAVK,B0001ADAVK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1129886776000,1,False
4.0,"Geez, what a FLIPPIN' IDIOT! GOSH!","Last summer's runaway indie comedy smash ($400,000 budget, $40 million gross to date), Napoleon Dynamite, won't make everyone laugh. OK, maybe most people won't laugh, but this is a film with a fiercely loyal cult following (count how many Vote For Pedro shirts you see on your campus) that will appeal to former teen outcasts, nerds and Aspies (OK, so maybe the Aspie bit is redundant). Napoleon is a geeky high schooler/prodigal Aspie who wears snow boots in summer, draws Pegasus and unicorns in his Trapper Keeper, and lives with his very butch grandmother, a finicky llama named Tina, and Kip, his nerdy older brother who ""chats online with babes all day"" and is training to be a cage fighter (yeah, right).<br /><br />Napoleon's school life consists of getting beat up by the resident jocks, and his home life isn't much better. (""How was school?"" his grandmother asks Napoleon. ""The worst day of my life, what do you think?"").  He soon meets Deb, a geeky, painfully shy neighbor who is earning money for college by producing glamour shots in her basement and selling those funky boondoggle keychains (I am SO a child of the `80s!), and Pedro, a Mexican fresh across the border, who answers everything in a syllable or less, wears holy medals, and has santo candles ringing his bathtub.<br /><br />The movie is filled with out-there moments: after Napoleon's grandma breaks her tailbone on the sand dunes (don't even ask!), his obnoxious Uncle Rico (which means ""rich"" in Spanish, appropriate because Rico is full of failed get-rich-quick schemes) comes to stay. Rico and Napoleon engage in heated battle, including flinging steaks and grapefruit at each other from moving vehicles, testing a time machine they bought online (which produces groinal electrocution), and Kip finally meets his Internet chat room honey LaFawnduh in the ample flesh (I thought, after a prolonged setup, that....well, never mind, put the pieces together for yourself. Hint: it involves Kip's comment about never seeing a full bodyshot of LaFawnduh before they meet).<br /><br />Napoleon now has a gang of loyal geek outcasts, and the trio try to make their way through another horrible school year, including the prom and class elections. This leads to the film's funniest scene involving Napoleon, an awesome Jamiroquai song (Canned Heat), and D-Kwon's Dance Grooves. Actually, I found this film to be hysterical, being a) a child of the `80s and b) an incorrigible social outcast in high school. Warning: if you are one of the people who enjoys this kind of humor, be careful not to inhale your popcorn and choke during the many funny scenes that creep up unawares.",[],B00005JNBQ,B00005JNBQ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1129504039000,1,False
5.0,Finding your soulmate in the playground of Paris...,"""Before Sunset"" is the sequel to 1995's ""Before Sunrise,"" which followed Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) on a magical night in Vienna.  Nine years later, our protagonists are older, wiser, and more wounded by love and relationships, desperately clinging to the idea of how their lives would have changed if they had met each other as planned six months after their first encounter.<br /><br />Jessie is in Paris promoting his new book at Shakespeare and Co. bookstore, on the last leg of a whirlwind publicity tour of ten cities in twelve days, when Celine shows up at the question and answer session. Floored, Jessie slips out with Celine for a quick coffee, which predictably turns into a late afternoon bathed in Paris's charms and beauty: a bateau mouche (boat ride) down the Seine (""It's for tourists!"" Celine protests weakly), walking through quiet, manicured gardens, sharing a coffee in a typical Paris café, and finally, listening to Nina Simone in Celine's charming (and cluttered apartment).<br /><br />The late afternoon light bathes Paris in a hazy film of romance and possibility. The locations, from narrow Parisian sidestreets, cruising under ponts (bridges) on the Seine, to landmarks such as Notre Dame, are stunning, and seem much more alive than did Vienna in the first film. Jessie and Celine have grown up: Jessie is married with children, and Celine is in a relationship with a war photojournalist, but the initial attraction in Vienna is still there, only tempered with anger and bitterness at life's unfairness. Much of the film is spent in arguments about the cruelty of love, trapped in loveless relationships, and giving up on the hope of ever meeting ""the one."" This film is much more grounded in reality, and as such, is missing a bit of the feel-good romance from ""Before Sunrise."" There is also much more graphic dialogue concerning sex and sex acts in frank, frequently explicit language, although no sex occurs in the film.<br /><br />The ending, at least, is much more open-ended and positive than its predecessor, and Ethan Hawke mentions in the behind-the-scenes feature that he hopes to follow Celine and Jessie down the road, perhaps every ten years or so. The DVD comes with the theatrical trailer and a ten-minute behind-the-scenes feature which shows limited filming on location and interviews with Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and director Richard Linklater. Bonus: the French-language track was dubbed in Québec rather than France. (For someone from Québec, there's poetic justice in hearing Parisians speak with a (loathed) Québécois accent!)

4.0,"A haunting tale of war, loss, and society's marginalized","""Turtles can Fly"" is a drama set in Kurdistan (on the Turkey-Iraq border) shortly before the Americans invade Iraq in 2003. Satellite is the ringleader of the refugee camp's hoards of orphaned children, who earn a meager living picking live landmines out of fields. Many are missing hands, arms, or legs. At the beginning of the film, the town's villagers are trying to install ancient antennas to catch word of when the war will begin, but Satellite rightly predicts that only a satellite dish will work for picking up foreign channels. Satellite's sidekick Pashow has lost a leg to the mines, and hobbles frantically behind Satellite, trying to keep up as he barks orders to assign his ""workers"" to new mine fields. The children sell the mines to arms dealers, who sell them to the UN.<br /><br />We soon meet Agrin and Hengov, brother and sister, who are displaced and live in the refugee camp. Their parents were murdered by the Iraqi army, and tagging along with them is their little brother Riga, who, although blind, is a very intelligent, sensitive toddler. Hengov has lost both arms to a mine, and works alone, not talking to the other village and refugee children. It is said that he has the ability to predict the future. His beautiful, haunted, suicidal sister begrudgingly cares for Riga, who she lets wander away at night. Satellite is attracted to Agrin, attempting to impress her by carrying water for her, diving into a haunted pond to look for red fish, and telling her that he's been looking for a girl like her all his life, but she just walks away, back to the misery of her tent and her lot in life.<br /><br />The war eventually reaches the town, and we see American troops rumbling through, but more and more tragedy occurs to the most defenseless: the children, living in mud-soaked, filthy camps, who spend their days picking through shell casings and unexploded land mines.<br /><br />The ending is stark and powerful, and director Ghobadi blends mysticism with gritty realism, the young cast all non-professional actors. His distrust of the West is portrayed in scenes that show ""forbidden channels"" on the satellite, music videos and such from Germany, and the inaccurate reporting from CNN. When the village elders try to force Satellite to translate, he just says ""they're saying it will rain tomorrow,"" but later in the film, we find that he does know a bit of English and inadvertently teaches it to the other children.<br /><br />This is a film full of disturbing images: violence, rape, maiming and suicide of children, so sensitive viewers beware. It is slow to start off, but is an ultimately rewarding journey of the horrors of war and the fate of the marginalized, orphaned children that war produces.",[],B000A7LR82,B000A7LR82,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1129208191000,21,False
5.0,The dream duo from Am&eacute;lie does it again!,"A Very Long Engagement is based on the novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot, and follows a spunky Breton girl crippled by polio, Mathilde (played by the luminous Audrey Tautou from Am&eacute;lie) as she searches for her fianc&eacute;, who was supposedly executed for treason during WWI. Several of the cast and crew from Am&eacute;lie reappear, including Ticky Holgado, who plays an oily private detective, director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, whose rich colors saturate and bring to life bygone eras with ease. There are some similarities to Am&eacute;lie: Mathilde says to herself, ""If I reach the bend in the road before the car, Manech will come home alive,"" and other such similar incantations in an effort to stave off bad luck.<br /><br />The story switches between Mathilde's quest for the truth as she infiltrates military archives, tracks down wives of the other soldiers executed for self-mutilation, and struggles to maintain hope that her fianc&eacute; Manech (the charmingly boyish Gaspard Ulliel) somehow survived the brutal punishment of being tossed into No Man's Land and left to fend for himself, and Manech's experiences in the horrific front line trenches filled with mud, rats, and corpses, constant shellings, and the spectre of death that stalks them. We see men blown apart into shockingly vibrant confetti, stabbings by bayonet, murders, and the darkest sides of humanity that war brings out in people. There are a confusing number of characters, particularly in the trenches, but Jeunet makes an effort to develop distinct personalities for each since they all have similar appearances.<br /><br />One highlight is Jodie Foster as the Polish wife of one of the officers in Manech's company. Jodie was fluent in French by the age of fourteen, and does all her own voiceovers in French editions of her films, so it was a charming surprise to see her delightful character here.<br /><br />Beautiful on-location scenery in Brittany (Finist&egrave;re), Paris, and the countryside, a lush soundtrack, vibrant cinematography, eye-popping visual effects, and a luminous optimism for life in the midst of the horrors of war, A Very Long Engagement is sure to delight fans of Am&eacute;lie, WWI buffs, and lovers of romance alike.<br /><br />The bonus DVD includes segments on how the film's incredible visual effects were accomplished, a documentary of Paris in the 1920s, deleted scenes with director's commentary, and a making of featurette.<br /><br />Rated R for graphic violence, sex, and nudity.",[],B0007Z0NYQ,B0007Z0NYQ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1129206998000,5,False
5.0,An uplifting tale about living life on one's own terms and overcoming incredible odds....,"Christy Brown was born to a large Dublin family (he had 13 surviving siblings) in 1932. Born with severe athetoid cerebral palsy, Christy was unable to speak or control his limbs.  At that time, the only course of action was to institutionalize CP children, but Christy's loving family refused to do so, so he grew up as one of the gang: participating in alley football matches, being dragged around town in his wheelbarrow, and included in family dinners. For years, Christy was unable to speak or communicate, until he discovers that he can write with his left foot, the only limb that he can partially control. His mother (Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar for her performance) loves him with all her heart, but fears that he is retarded as well, until one day, pouring sweat and out of breath from his exertions, he writes ""Mother"" on the floor with a piece of chalk. His family is dumbfounded.<br /><br />Christy progresses to painting with his left foot. As Christy enters adulthood, he meets Dr. Eileen, who wants him to participate at a new cerebral palsy clinic in Dublin. Christy goes once, but is shamed and uncomfortable around so many others like him, and demands to be taken home instead. Dr. Eileen starts making house visits to work with Christy on controlling muscle spasms, breath control, and how to speak more clearly. Christy quickly falls in love with Eileen, attempting to recite and memorize Shakespeare in order to win her love. His mother says darkly, ""There's too much hope in his voice. A broken body doesn't need a broken heart.""<br /><br />Eileen and her fiancé arrange an exhibition of Christy's paintings, and at a disastrous dinner afterwards, Christy gets stone drunk and makes a scene as Eileen relays her engagement to Peter. ""Congratulations on your wonderful news,"" Christy spits bitterly, sarcastically. ""I'm glad you taught me how to speak so I could say that, Eileen.""<br /><br />After his heartbreak, Christy attempts multiple times to commit suicide, but the continuing love and support of his family keeps him above water, if barely. His parents build him a room of his own where he can paint and write in peace. Christy's father dies soon afterwards, and Christy publishes his autobiography in order to earn money for his family.<br /><br />The movie's narrative structure is unique as well: the film begins with Christy getting ready to go to a benefit, and throughout the film we cut back to the present as he waits to go on, where a nurse reads his autobiography, and back to Christy's past.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis (adult Christy) and Hugh O'Connor (young Christy) are a seamless transition. It is obvious that both spent time in CP clinics observing the behavior, movements and mannerisms of CP patients; they portray Christy with sensitivity and an eye for how difficult the simplest things were for him.<br /><br />This is an incredible movie. After seeing ""Rory O'Shea Was Here,"" another film about CP adults and caregivers (including Brenda Fricker), I wanted to see ""My Left Foot"" for myself after reading so many comparisons.  The Special Edition DVD features several trailers for other Miramax films and a making-of, featuring vintage footage of Christy's family and interviews with his mother. My only disappointment was the terrible transfer quality of the DVD; the film was grainy, with multiple specks of dust and dirt on every frame, and looked more like a worn-out VHS tape. Shame on Miramax for calling this remastered.<br /><br />The film is rated R (profanity, domestic violence, suicide attempts and massive alcohol use).",[],B00008L3RY,B00008L3RY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1127475487000,32,False
4.0,Bollywood has arrived!,"Much to the utter confusion of my parents, I have been in love with Bollywood and bhangra for years. Bollywood is India's massive film industry based in Bombay (now Mumbai), which produces more films annually than Hollywood. Bollywood films are formulaic, musical tales that combine a number of genres: action, musicals, romances, and tragedy. There are always hundreds of extras that break into song and dance at the drop of a turban. With Bollywood, suspension of disbelief is required.<br /><br />Gurinder Chadha, mastermind behind the immensely popular ""Bend It Like Beckham"" (2002), returns at the helm of this Bollywood retelling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, adapting the novel to modern rural India and the Bakshi family, who owns a small farm in Amritsar. The four unmarried daughters (Jaya, Maya, Lakhi, and Lalita) are a source of constant fretting for their mother, who hopes to marry them off for their dowries. The dashingly handsome Londonite Balraj (Naveen Andrews) arrives at a wedding party, along with his American friend Will Darcy, a hotel heir. Jaya is smitten by Balraj, but Will Darcy makes a horrible first impression on Lalita, dismissing Indian culture and arranged marriages, which prompts an impassioned speech by Lalita about subservient, simple women.<br /><br />For most of the film, the two grate on each other's nerves whenever they meet. Lalita's mother tries to get her to marry the green-card holder Kholi, an obnoxious, chauvinist, hip-hop wannabe who spouts phrases like ""Word up!"" and does mock-gang hand symbols, bragging about his million-dollar house in L.A. Lalita refuses, and Kholi ends up marrying her best friend. Feeling betrayed, she runs into Johnny Wickham at Goa, and is instantly attracted to him. He warns her about Will Darcy, but Lalita soon finds that appearances can be deceiving.<br /><br />In typical Bollywood style, the various plots and romances cross in and out and intertwine, sprinkled with several show-stopping numbers (the extended versions, some over ten minutes, are included as bonus features), brilliantly colorful costumes, and exotic tastes of India throughout: crowded marketplaces, the Golden Temple of Amritsar used as a backdrop, wedding saris, trays of Indian sweets.<br /><br />Having a history of Bollywood films, I loved this, but the marriage of Bollywood and Hollywood seemed a bit foreign even to me. Having Indian choruses breaking out in clearly dubbed English instead of Hindi was off-putting. At times, the editing could have benefited from extra cutting, as the film felt overly long, even with the musical numbers scaled down. Western audiences may be turned off by the Bollywood conventions, which are not spelled out or explained, such as Aishwarya Rai not kissing Martin Henderson. In Bollywood, kissing or sexual contact is taboo and is represented by chirping birds, crashing waves, etc., so we never see the two kiss on-screen.<br /><br />Aishwarya Rai is Bollywood's biggest star. She gained 20 pounds for the role so as not to appear model-thin; she wanted to be seen as ""normal."" This is her first film entirely in English, and she does all of her own singing. Her luminous beauty makes her perfect for the role.<br /><br />The music is also available as a soundtrack, both in an English version and a Hindi version. Ashanti has a cameo in the film as a tribute to the Bollywood convention of having a famous singer sing a song on-screen that has nothing to do with the movie's plot. Her number is sizzling, and was shot live after she was flown in to Goa for the shoot.<br /><br />The DVD contains numerous extras, including a director's commentary, extended songs, Ashanti's music video, interviews with Aishwarya Rai and Martin Henderson (Johnny Depp and Joaquin Phoenix were both considered for the role of Mr. Darcy - I would have loved to see Johnny Depp, personally!), a making-of, and more.<br /><br />Bollywood fans will love this, as will people who enjoy Indian music or who are open-minded about how movies should look or sound. I don't think this is nearly as bad as many fans and critics made it out to be; Gurinder will forever be measured up to ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" which she may never top in popularity or cohesiveness, but ""Bride and Prejudice"" has much to recommend it.",[],B00094AS9U,B00094AS9U,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1127390884000,6,False
5.0,"Wingapo, Pocahontas! My favorite Disney movie returns in style.","Pocahontas was, in my opinion, the last great traditional Disney animated film. I was fifteen when it came out, at the age where Disney movies soon became a thing of the past.  I was attracted to Pocahontas for a number of reasons: I had spend childhood spring breaks in Williamsburg, VA and Jamestown, I spent summers Up North running through the woods of Northern Michigan, and ever since childhood, I have been active in Native American culture and crafts: learning the Native American flute, working at powwows, teaching about Native American culture in Quebec, and giving craft demonstrations of making dreamcatchers, among other things.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the real Pocahontas (who was around eleven or twelve at the time of her encounter with John Smith), Disney's adaptation features all of the Disney prerequisites: talking animal sidekicks, a beautiful, independent heroine, flashy musical numbers, and a love story. However, Pocahontas marked a departure for Disney as well: it was the first film to deviate from the traditional animation style and the first to be based on historical events rather than fairy tales.<br /><br />To their credit, Disney put a lot of research into the Native American language and customs portrayed in the film. In one interview, the director mentions having a shaman visit the studio, in another segment, a deleted song about Powhatan wedding customs was mentioned for the amount of research. The film also features Native American actors in several roles, including Russell Means (Lakota) as Chief Powhatan, Irene Bedard (Inupiat and Cree) as Pocahontas, Gordon Tootoosis (Cree) as Kekata, and Michelle St. John (Cree) as Nakoma. After watching the bonus material, it is evident what an amazing amount of research and devotion Disney poured into this project. Yes, there are groups that attack the film as a commercial sell-out of Native American culture, but isn't it better to get kids interested in other cultures and traditions from a young age?<br /><br />Pocahontas is a wild spirit who would rather be canoeing down the river instead of talking about marriage proposals, as her father, Chief Powhatan, wants her to (Pocahontas says of her intended husband Kocoum, ""He's so...serious"").  Adventure comes her way when the dashing soldier John Smith and a shipload of English settlers lands at Jamestown in 1607 (which, ironically, is nowhere near as hilly or lush as the animation would have you believe).  The settlers, driven by the vile Governor Ratcliffe, are sure that the ""savages"" (Native Americans) have hidden the gold that is supposed to be in the New World, and are involved in a number of skirmishes with Pocahontas's tribe.<br /><br />Pocahontas meets John Smith and it is love at first sight. The two risk everything to be together, but a tragedy threatens to pull them apart. Unlike most Disney films, this one doesn't have a storybook ending (and unfortunately, was yet another victim of the detestable direct-to-video sequels with substandard animation, average songs, and a plot that basically ignored everything that happened in the original film), and was left open ended.<br /><br />Pocahontas also had one of the most mature and captivating instrumental scores, with a very sweeping, Native-American influenced backing of lush strings, cedar flute, and drums. I didn't care as much for the musical numbers, with the exception of ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colors of the Wind."" One neat bonus is a multi-language reel of ""Colors of the Wind"" sung in Icelandic, Slovenian, Polish, Korean, Japanese, German, French and French-Canadian, Turkish, Arabic, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few!<br /><br />For the 10th anniversary edition, Disney has truly outdone themselves with the sheer number of extras: a two-disc set that features new animation and a new song (""If I Never Knew You,"" a duet between John Smith and Pocahontas), a multi-language reel, activities for the kids, including sing alongs, a ""making of,"" and original storyboards and deleted sequences with commentary by the directors, producers, and composers. The film has been completely remastered and is presented in 5.1 digital surround, and sounds better than ever.<br /><br />A truly beautiful package worthy of my favorite Disney film (and plenty to keep the kids engaged as well!).",[],B0007KTBIU,B0007KTBIU,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1127009100000,2,False

At the end of the birthing season, a rare white camel is born, but after its difficult birth, the mother refuses to suckle it and it risks death by starvation.<br /><br />The Mongolian family that owns the camel (parents, three children, and grandparents) tries various remedies to ensure bonding between the mother camel and her son, but without success.  Drastic measures are called for, and Buddhist monks and an outside music teacher are brought in for a healing ceremony.  Originally filmed as a documentary, the footage of the camels birthing is amazing.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, with lush, vibrant colors that highlight the monochromatic Gobi Desert, and that captures the daily exotic rhythm of life in rural Mongolia with a simple beauty.

Although the four are apart for the summer (Lena is visiting family in Santorini, Greece, Bridget attends a soccer camp in Mexico, and Carmen visits her divorced father), they are linked by a pair of magic jeans that fits each of them perfectly.  The four soon draw up rules for their sisterhood (""no washing the pants, no one but the wearer may remove the pants,""), and keep in touch in the form of letters and narratives.<br /><br />The film is split between the adventures of the four: Lena's first love, Tibby's friendship with a spunky, terminally ill girl, Bridget's crush and pursuit of an attractive soccer coach, and Carmen's struggle to deal with her father remarrying.  The narrative is fairly well balanced and the pacing doesn't lag.  There is no overly objectionable content (several kisses, minor swear words), and parents may find themselves enjoying this sweet summer film as well.",[],B000AM4PEK,B000AM4PEK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1124910202000,2,False
4.0,"A solid, emotional page-to-screen translation of a young adult classic","Jane Yolen's ""The Devil's Arithmetic"" is a classroom fixture and a benchmark in young adult literature for its vivid yet sensitive portrayal of the Holocaust.  In this Showtime made-for-TV adaptation, introduced and produced by Dustin Hoffman (himself from a family of Polish Jews), the novel is brought to life in a way that shows younger viewers the horrors of the Holocaust without being overtly gory.<br /><br />Modern teenager Hannah Stern resents being made to participate in her Aunt Eva's Passover celebrations, feeling no attachment to her religion.  As her relatives, all concentration camp survivors, try to recount their experiences, Hannah turns away, bored.  All of this changes as Hannah is chosen to perform the ritual act of opening the door for the Prophet Elijah--instead of the hallway of her aunt's apartment, Hannah is transported to rural Jewish Poland, circa 1941.<br /><br />Hannah attempts to make sense of her old life, and the girl her new Polish ""family"" expects her to be.  As time passes, more and more of her old life becomes a dream.  Hannah and her cousin Rivkah explore the town before attending a wedding, at which point Nazis round up the wedding guests and load them onto trucks.<br /><br />The remainder of the film focuses on the day-to-day struggle to live in the concentration camp in powerful moments of stolen identities: the grim shearing of hair, the painful tattoos of blue numbers, the bitter cold and backbreaking labour.  Although this is a children's film, there are plenty of grim realities: the beating and hanging of several men who attempt to escape, women suffocating in a gas chamber.<br /><br />Several previous reviewers have mentioned inaccuracies (swing music, banned by Hitler in 1938, is played in a lounge), but despite the small flaws, for a low-budget film, it captures the drama and power of the original novel.  Much of the original plot has been changed, mostly for the better, but readers may find some transitions confusing.<br /><br />The film's acting, cinematography, costumes, and sound editing are all top-notch.  There are moments of quiet beauty, of love that transcends time, of the will to survive against the odds.  Kirsten Dunst gives a stunning performance as a spoiled teen that learns the meaning of ultimate sacrifice, cherishing her heritage and religion when confronted with the horrors of the Holocaust.  An excellent companion to the novel, and a good introduction to the Holocaust for young teens.",[],B0002CX1NY,B0002CX1NY,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1124746769000,9,True
4.0,"""Der Krieger und die Kaiserin"" an edgy journey","""Der Krieger und die Kaiserin"" (the literal translation is The Empress and the Warrior, but the director preferred ""princess"" for the English version) is the sixth film from young German director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run).  I'd looked at the DVD several times before, curious, but when I finally watched it, I was disturbed by several gory scenes and the dark tone of the picture.  However, like driving by a brutal accident, you can't help but look.  This film was the same way for me...it haunted me for days until I sat down and watched it again with a new appreciation for Mr. Tykver's craft.<br /><br />Instead of giving away any of the plot, you have to see the film for yourself to make sense of the multiple storylines.  I will say that fate and destiny are at the heart of the film. ""The Princess and the Warrior"" runs a little over two hours, and does feel like it could have benefited from tighter editing in spots.  There are several disturbing sequences (a sexual act between a nurse and a patient, an emergency tracheotomy, suicide attempts, murder) that are definitely not for the faint of heart (hence the R rating).<br /><br />The story is slow to unfold, but ultimately rewarding.  Instead of the intense energy that bathed Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior is more subdued; a downward spiral of depression, dark desires, painful secrets, and finally, redemption by love. The haunting music (composed by Tykwer) perfectly complements the melancholic tension onscreen---single heavy piano notes fading into silence, bells, and the eerie theme song ""You Can't Find Peace"" (the music video is included on the DVD).<br /><br />The DVD transfer deserves an A+.  Great care was taken in terms of menu design (although the chapter menu can be a bit confusing at first) and extras (making of, numerous deleted scenes, music video, cast (Franka Potente, Benno Fürmann) and director's commentary, filmographies, trailers and more).  The making of, like most making ofs, includes more shots from the actual film than behind-the-scenes (and is entirely in German to boot).  If you want to hear the real scoop, be sure to listen to the various audio commentaries. The commentaries are generally fun and interesting (all the cast and crew speak near-native English), and the actors talk about scene motivation, grueling shoots, and funny memories from the set. I would recommend renting this movie before purchasing it, as it will only appeal to a certain audience.",[],B00005U8EN,B00005U8EN,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1097363758000,11,False
5.0,"A sublime portrait of tortured souls and muses, art and love","Girl With A Pearl Earring, based on Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name, chronicles the creation of one of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's greatest paintings. Griet (the luminous Scarlett Johansson) becomes a maid at the Vermeer house after a family tragedy, and learns to adapt to the dynamics of the Vermeer household: a jealous, constantly-pregnant wife (Essie Davis, bearing a striking resemblance to Cate Blanchett's Queen Elizabeth), a shrewd mother-in-law in charge of finances and keeping Johannes' wandering in check, and a gaggle of children underfoot (one of whom hates Griet from day one and makes life miserable for her). While at the Vermeers, Griet meets Pieter, the butcher's assistant, and the two begin a slow courtship as the seasons pass.<br />The film's main story follows Vermeer's struggle to paint (he only produced around 35 canvases his entire career) with little money for supplies and the household, an iron-fisted mother-in-law that disdains him and urges him to paint more and faster, and the frustration at being with people who do not understand his calling, the intricacies of colour, texture, light and shadow. Enter Griet, who possesses a sensitive, artistic nature and is assigned to clean Vermeer's studio. Before long she is secretly grinding and mixing paints for Vermeer in between her other household chores, and one fateful day Vermeer asks Griet to sit for him. She does so reluctantly, afraid to invoke the wrath of his wife, but Vermeer quietly forces her to bend to his will, including piercing her ears so that she can wear his wife's earrings for the painting. Griet is found out, and all hell breaks loose. The film's finest moment is when Griet poses for the infamous painting, a haunted look in her liquid eyes. ""You have looked inside me,"" she accuses Vermeer.<br />There is a great deal of unrealized sexual tension between maid and master, the smallest movement an expression of unspoken desire: the accidental brush of a hand, a thumb's caress as an earring is put in, the furtive glimpse of Griet's hair that entrances Johannes. One of Vermeer's regular patrons lusts after Griet and attempts to rape her, leaving Vermeer angry but helpless to turn down the commission.<br />This is a gorgeous film, lushly sensual and full of moments of quiet beauty. Each scene is composed as though a Vermeer painting, careful studies in placement, colour, and light.  Colin Firth plays a superbly tortured soul seeking his muse, and Scarlett Johansson is radiant as the timid, blossoming Griet, tantalized by that which she can never have. Slow to unfold but deliciously rewarding, and one of the best films of the last few years.",[],B0001US61O,B0001US61O,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1083899226000,1,False
5.0,A joyous mosaic of life in the European Union,"""L'auberge espagnole"" was playing at the time I lived in Spain (fall 2002), but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Now, more than a year later after returning home, this charming film made me realize how much I enjoyed my experiences studying in Spain, cherished my friendships with other Erasmus students, and relived the embarrassing ""fish out of water"" moments that made my stay so memorable.<br />Directed by C&eacute;dric Klapisch, ""L'auberge espagnole"" tells the tale of Xavier (Romain Duris), a twentysomething Parisian studying economics. Xavier decides to spend a year at the Universitat de Barcelona as an Erasmus student (a university exchange between EU member countries), and along the way he meets an assortment of other European students, locals, and transplanted French (a local at a bar offers to teach him ""puta madre"" Spanish, which made me laugh out loud.)<br />Xavier arrives in Barcelona disoriented and brokenhearted at having to leave his girlfriend and the comfort of familiarity behind. Weighted down by a myriad of bags (which brought back plenty of memories of my arriving in Spain similarly loaded down), he wanders the unfamiliar streets, alone and friendless, not speaking either language fluently (Castillano, the official language of Spain, and Catal&aacute;n, the official language of Catalunya and Barcelona). After ditching the morose boarding accommodations provided by a friend of his hippie mother's, Xavier begins the grueling and expensive task of finding a flat.<br />His search lands him in a flat with six other Erasmus students: Londoner Wendy (a noted clean freak), Aragonese Soledad, the gorgeous Italian Alessandro, Tobias from Germany, the Dane Lars, and latecomer Isabelle from Belgium. Slowly, Xavier adjusts to his new life: an utter lack of privacy, homesickness for his girlfriend Martine (Audrey Tautou from Am&eacute;lie), studying, balanced with the occasional joint and night out clubbing. The seven flatmates generally get along, speaking with each other in English and Spanish. A wrench is thrown into the mix when Wendy's obnoxious brother William (Kevin Bishop) comes to spend two weeks with them and ends up offending everyone.<br />Xavier also becomes infatuated with the wife of a French doctor working in Barcelona and the two begin an affair. Although he believes himself to be an adequate lover, Xavier is coached by the lesbian Isabelle on how to truly please a woman, and the result, as Xavier says, is ""like something from the movies.""<br />The film is beautiful to look at, showcasing the architecture of Gaud&iacute; (Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell), the swaying palm trees, blue water and sandy beaches of Barcelona, and Paris at intervals as well.  The film's humor is reflected in the editing, ""you are here"" labels, and special effects. The music is an upbeat mix of new and old that perfectly reflects modern Europe, including contributions by Radiohead, Ali Farka Toure, Vicente Amigo, Kouz-1, Daft Punk and the late Arthur Rubinstein.<br />My only complaints would be the lack of extras (there was a made-for-TV documentary of the making of (or ""making off"" as you'll see in France and Spain) the film, European Confusion, not included here), and the rather high price. The DVD contains both the widescreen and fullscreen versions.<br />Overall, a gem of a film that brought back many happy memories of living in Spain (Burgos, in my case) and made me homesick for the many wonderful people and experiences I had while living there (I hope to teach in Barcelona in the near future). &iexcl;Viva Espa&ntilde;a!",[],B0000C9JFO,B0000C9JFO,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1077768827000,21,False
4.0,�Holes� a satisfying film on many levels�,"After reading/hearing many positive reviews regarding Disney's latest film ""Holes,"" I rented a copy to see for myself. Although billed as a children's film (Disney no less), ""Holes"" deals with universal elements of friendship, loyalty, and destiny, with a healthy dose of intrigue, tension and danger to boot. There are many adult elements in the film, such as a mob killing, bandits and an interracial romance in Old Texas, but the movie is easy for a younger audience to connect with as well.<br />Based on the popular children's book by Louis Sachar (I read several books by Mr. Sachar in elementary school), ""Holes"" is the story of Stanley Yelnats and company, boys who have been sent to Camp Green Lake, Texas to be ""rehabilitated"" after brushes with the law. The boys are forced to dig an endless number of deep holes in the desert in order to build character, but it quickly becomes evident that overseers Mr. Sir and the Warden have other plans in mind besides character building: lost treasure. Stanley befriends the D Tent boys: Zero, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, Magnet and Zigzag, and in the spirit of the Three Musketeers it's one for all and all for one as the boys struggle to make it from day to day cut off from family and society.<br />Stanley (Shia LaBeouf from ""Even Stevens"") and Zero/Hector (Khleo Thomas) quickly develop a bond as Zero helps him dig his holes and Stanley teaches Zero how to read. The two escape from the camp and must help each other survive in the ruthless heat and dust storms, and along the way they discover the secret of Camp Green Lake and the Kissing Bandit.<br />Extras were decent, including a ""gag reel"" that was mostly footage from the film  (no bloopers or anything of that nature), a  ""Dig It"" music video by the D Tent boys, several deleted scenes, two commentaries (a cast commentary geared towards a younger audience and one for the adult crowd by director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Louis Sachar-a marvelous idea for kids' DVDs), ""On the Set with Louis Sachar"" and a making-of featurette.<br />There are several moments of violence (fights, several deaths and near-death experiences, gunplay), implied romance, and no overly offensive language (""Holes"" is rated PG).<br />Overall this is a great movie, full of friendship, scheming, overcoming challenges, bandits and buried treasure, along with poisonous lizards, onions, and shoe odour!",[],B00005JLYQ,B00005JLYQ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1067267992000,3,False
5.0,"A gorgeous whirlwind of passion, colour and duende.","&quot;Frida&quot; possesses that mythical essence which the Spanish call duende: magic spirit or inspiration. The entire film--performances, music, visuals, explodes with passion and colour. We see Frida from her beginnings as an impetuous schoolgirl and her first introduction to future husband Diego Rivera, to her death at age forty-seven. In between we are priviledged to Frida's unique perspectives of life, love and art, everything drenched in vivid colours, ripe with possibility, a tango of pain and passion.<br />The cast includes many high-profile names, such as Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffry Rush, Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, and Edward Norton. I am amazed at how well Julie Taymor (the Lion King Broadway musical) has captured the feel of Mexico during the early-to-mid 20th century:  the revolutionary atmosphere, inequalities, the textures and smells of everyday life.<br />The most impressive part of the film for me was the music and visuals. The soundtrack includes a liberal dose of traditional Mexican tunes and singers, including Chavela Vargas, a legendary folk singer and one of Frida's real-life lovers. It was incredibly powerful to see the weathered face of Vargas as she serenades Salma's Frida; one can only imagine what memories she was recalling of her time with the real Frida. Mexican folk singer Lila Downs also contributes, as does Caetano Veloso and Hayek herself on &quot;La Bruja.&quot;<br />Taymor uses Frida's actual paintings as inspiration for the visuals, at times combining live action with Frida's paintings, photo montages, and puppets to bring to life Frida's creative genius, trying to go behind the paintings into the events that inspired them.<br />The two-disc DVD comes with several short extras on visual effects, interviews with Chavela Vargas and Lila Downs, Salma's recording session,  Although overly ambitious and sidetracked at times, &quot;Frida&quot; manages to paint an unforgettable portrait of a fiery spirit: communist, painter, wife, lover, infused with the soul and passion of Mexico.",[],B00005JLPK,B00005JLPK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1059963916000,6,False
5.0,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" a harrowing tale of loss and courage","Phillip Noyce's ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is based on the true story of Daisy, Molly and Gracie, three half-caste children in Western Australia in 1931. The Australian government continued enforcing until 1970 a law that allowed mixed race children to be removed forcibly from their parents and sent to boarding schools to ""educate"" them for a white world. The girls were trained to be servants and domestics. The whole system was similar to the Indian schools in the United States, where First Nations children were sent to be raised as pious, productive, educated young adults, but the system there too frequently failed. The plan was that the half-caste girls would marry whites or other half-castes and have the Aboriginal ""bred out of them,"" as policy director A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) explains to a local ladies' society.<br />Daisy, Molly and Gracie are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement in Perth, over 2000 kilometres from their home in Jigalong Station. They do not last more than a few days before Molly, the ringleader, plans their escape through brush and desert, finding her way home by following the rabbit-proof fence, the longest in the world, that divides pasture from rabbit-infested bush. Neville and his men, including a skilled Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (film veteran David Gulpilil) search for weeks in pursuit of the girls, and one is eventually recaptured in a harrowing scene, only steps from safety with the other girls.<br />There is very little in the way of dialogue, and although Noyce's child actors are all unskilled, there are remarkable performances and true moments of fear, desperation, and grief shine through. The girls' mother and grandmother are particularly effective at conveying the mind-shattering grief they must live with knowing that they may never see their girls again. In one touching scene, at separate points on the fence, thousands of kilometres apart, both the mother and the girls tightly grip the fence, lightly shaking it, as if they could feel the resulting vibrations and sense the others' presence there.<br />The cinematography shows off the dry palette of the desert, the spectacular desert sunsets, the shimmering wave of heat that covers the landscape. This film reminded me in some ways of the 1971 Australian film ""Walkabout,"" which starred Gulpilil as an Aboriginal teenager, and follows two white children that are stranded in the outback with only Gulpilil as a guide. The ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" score by Peter Gabriel is low-key and appropriately tension-filled, meditative and mysterious at key moments, with wisps of Aboriginal chant and song woven into a lush synth background, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to Australian sci-fi series ""Ocean Girl"" by Garry McDonald and Laurie Stone. The narration at the beginning and end of the movie was the most powerful for me: the real-life Molly and Daisy, now old women in bright clothes that are startlingly out of place against the backdrop of the outback they slowly walk through, tell how the story ended. And that was the saddest truth of all.<br />The included documentary ""Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence"" shows Noyce flying to remote outback communities looking for Aboriginal child actors, auditioning thousands of hopefuls before settling on the final three, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan, as well as the emotional journey for the temperamental star and the harrowing experience of filming the girls' abduction at the hands of a white officer. Pretty much the whole cast and crew was in tears and shaken afterwards, forced to relive the crucial moment that defined the ""Stolen Generations:"" the theft from their mothers' arms, some never to be seen or heard from again.<br />An excellent film that treats a little-known subject outside of Australia (and fairly unspoken within), with the fresh-faced innocence of children who beat the odds and found their way home across 2000 km of largely uninhabited, hostile terrain to the waiting arms of their family.",[],B00005JLD4,B00005JLD4,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1053173874000,13,False
4.0,"Sail away on a tide of romance, betrayal and dark secrets","In Will and Ian Ferguson's underrated masterpiece ""How To Be A Canadian,"" there is a chapter entitled ""Art and Stuff,"" in which they discuss Canadian literature, and in doing so identified the following elements present in ""The Shipping News"": incest, female character as empowered victim, graphic but ironic use of violent imagery, healing (but only at the end). This I have found true in a number of Canadian bestsellers. So how does ""The Shipping News"" hold up as a film in view of these dark elements?<br />First, practically none of the actors are from Newfoundland (with the exception of the fantastic Gorden Pinsent, frequently seen on ""Due South""), which is evident in the mangled accents. It gains some respectability back by being filmed on location (between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia). And the soundtrack, with five contributions from Newfoundland's own Great Big Sea, is a rollicking collection of sea chanties smoothed with guitar, tin whistles and strings during the quieter moments. However, none of the Great Big Sea songs were featured on the soundtrack CD (minus twenty points!).<br />The story (I don't want to give too much away since the story is certainly...original) deals with R.G. Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) and his scatterbrained girlfriend Petal (Cate Blanchett). The two have a young daughter, Bunny, and after Petal's demise Quoyle and Bunny head to Newfoundland to move into their ancestral home, along with Agnis Hamm, Quoyle's aunt. The rest of the story deals (somewhat predictably) with fitting into the new community, reconciliation with the past, brushes with death and the strength of family in the face of adversity. Quoyle works on the local newspaper writing the shipping news, which he adds his own personal touch to. We meet his coworkers (Billy, Tert, Beaufield and Jack), the lovely Wavey (Julianne Moore) who runs the local daycare and her mentally challenged son Herry, who becomes Bunny's playmate (another question: who NAMED these people?!), and long lost relatives and dark family secrets. There is a bit of strong language, alcohol use, violence (including a murder), disturbing images (including rape of a minor), and a brief sex scene, which give the film its R rating. If you enjoy artsy films, beautiful scenery, an unusual yarn, or Celtic (and Newfie) music, ""The Shipping News"" may be for you.",[],B0000640VK,B0000640VK,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1045844370000,1,False
5.0,A remarkable journey,"I saw �Spirited Away� two times in Spain (in Spanish, naturally), and it has become my absolute favourite of all of Hayao Miyazaki�s films. Miyazaki is, for me, the epitome of Japanese animation and the undisputed master of his craft. He fills the screen with minute details, doing most of the painstaking animation by hand in an age of computer animation (see Disney). His films are always unique both in visual style and in plot, expressing lost mythologies, alternate worlds, and the spirits that surround us. In Japan anime is not only for children, a concept which Western audiences have difficulty understanding. These are more than mere cartoons; they are explorations of self, nature, and in some ways Japanese society (there are frequently Japanese elements in many of Miyazaki�s films although most are set in fictitious places).<br />�Spirited Away� tells the lovely story of Chihiro, a ten-year-old Japanese girl that is moving to a new town. Along the way the family stops to explore a mysterious tunnel that turns out to be a pathway into an alternate world filled with gods, witches and strange creatures. Chihiro�s parents are transformed into large pigs as punishment for their gluttony (there are frequently morals in Miyazaki�s tales as well), and Chihiro begins work for the witch Yubaba while desperately trying to find a cure for her parents before they are eaten (!). She befriends Haku, a mysterious boy whom she feels some past connection to, and together the two attempt to overthrow the tyrannical reign of Yubaba.<br />A gorgeous film, with a beautiful soundtrack by frequent Miyazai collaborator Joe Hisaishi (�Princess Mononoke,� �Kiki�s Delivery Service,� �Totoro�). There are some elements that may be disturbing to very young children (the threat of Chihiro�s parents being eaten even as a pig�s head is shown at a feast, several scary rampages, some blood), but overall this is an excellent, quality film that is a feast for the eyes, ears, and imagination, and a true journey of the spirit.",[],B00005JLEU,B00005JLEU,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1044983861000,21,False
5.0,Everything that you do will come back to you...,"Yes, I have to say it: ""Happenstance"" (the original French title is ""The Beating of a Butterfly's Wings,"" referring to chaos theory) bears certain resemblances to the charming ""Amélie."" The most obvious comparison is that it stars Audrey Tautou, the wide-eyed innocent beauty from ""Amélie."" It, like ""Amélie,"" takes place in Paris and follows the lives of a group of people whose lives are intertwined by fate. The comparison ends there. ""Happenstance"" is difficult to categorize: it has elements of romance, humour, quiet desperation, racism, and the dark side of human nature. None of the small coincidences ever seems forced, no matter how trivial the first event nor how grand the repercussion may be. We meet people from all walks of life: an ill homeless man, a compulsive liar, a thief, Gypsy fortune tellers, sales clerks, a cheating husband and his mistress, an Algerian looking for true love after hearing his horoscope (played by gorgeous and talented raï singer Faudel). The smallest things in our lives can determine the course of events: throwing or not throwing a pebble, dropping a crumpled newspaper ad from a pocket, a cockroach crawling into a purse, hence the chaos theory, which is explained by one of the characters in the film. It's sort of a cycle of karma, if you will. Do something good for someone, and it will come back to you. Bear them a grudge and...well, I for one will always think twice about coffees in cafes after seeing Younès' revenge.

5.0,"When it rains, it pours....","""Monsoon Wedding"" is a gorgeous, engaging film on a number of different levels. It follows the Verma family as they prepare for their daughter Aditi's wedding to an Indian who had been living in Houston and working as a computer engineer (a common theme throughout the film is the Indian diaspora to Western countries in order to have a better chance at success, such as cousin Rahul, the family ""idiot"" just back from years in Australia (note: the Australian accent of actor Randeep Hooda is real: he obtained both his bachelor's and master's degrees in business management in Melbourne).<br />  The film is full of the hectic moments that can only come before stressful family gatherings such as weddings: shopping for wedding saris, building outdoor canopies, guest lists, preparations....compounded by the pouring rain of the monsoon season. ""Monsoon Wedding"" beautifully captures a vibrant modern India, at home in Hindi, Punjabi and English, turbans and T-shirts, and the showstopping spectacles of Bollywood. Music plays a large role in the film as a background element and also as dance numbers at the wedding, and Torontonian Mychael Danna (who also scored ""Monsoon Wedding"" director Mira Nair's ""Kama Sutra"") strikes a comfortable blend of Indian instruments and modalities with piano, bhangra rock, and several very catchy Bollywood tunes.<br />  The film is aided not only by the beautiful, exotic scenery, but also by the diverse cast of supporting characters: the scheming wedding planner Dubey, ""idiot"" cousin Rahul, just back from Australia and apparently an all-Australian boy, having shed most of his Indian customs and past, a sensitive younger brother more interested in cooking and dance than in sports or studies (""Let's find him a nice boy,"" the cranky father snaps), a cousin abused by a family member who must confront her past, and a myriad of shopkeepers, workers, and ordinary people that bring Delhi to life, much like Bombay in Manil Suri's excellent first novel ""The Death of Vishnu.""<br />  There are a number of humorous moments, tender exchanges between the bride and groom-to-be, who, as participants in an arranged marriage had never met until days before the wedding, lively dance numbers, and moments in daily life that could take place in any corner of the world, which make the story universal in spite of some cultural differences. The varying English accents can make the film at times difficult to understand (Randeep Hooda's Australian accent was surprisingly one of the easiest for me), and older family members especially only converse in Hindi and Punjabi (there are English subtitles). A most unusual love story on a number of levels: the renewal of love between an aging husband and wife, new love between the newlyweds, a heartfelt declaration of love from a wedding planner to a maid, budding love between those who have just met yet are instantly attracted. Add to that the exotic scenery, catchy Indian pop music and dance, beautiful saris and everyday touches of India, and a quirky cast of characters, and you have the exuberant whirlwind of sensations and emotions that is ""Monsoon Wedding.""

3.0,"A rather charming tale of conspiracies, birds, love and food","""Rare Birds"" chronicles the life of Dave (William Hurt), chef of ""The Auk"" in a small coastal town in Newfoundland. Business is sagging, and Dave is preparing to sell the restaurant when wacky Fonce (Newfoundlander Andy Jones in a brilliant turn as always) cooks up a scheme involving the sighting of a rare bird (in reality, an extinct duck) to bring flocks of birdwatchers to the area and boost business. The plan works, but the two get more than they bargain for: there are numerous other subplots, some unnecessary, such as the cocaine stash, a love affair between Dave and Alice, Fonce's bookish sister-in-law, the RCMP Bulgarian light conspiracy, and the Winnebegos.<br />Molly Parker's Alice was a delight, as was Andy Jones' neurotic Fonce. I thought that the entire cocaine subplot was unnecessary. The bathroom humour seemed too base as well, although limited to one (thankfully) brief scene. Although Ebert regards ""Rare Birds"" as more of a wacky Newfoundland character study than ""The Shipping News,"" I disagree. I found that ""The Shipping News"" had a much more engaging plot and much more involved characters. The pacing of ""Rare Birds"" is sometimes slow and awkward, and I didn't really relate to Hurt's character, which made it much harder to enjoy the film as a whole.<br />The DVD offers very little in the way of special features, mainly a few computer-generated sets from production designs, a trailer (which shows what the film *could * have been if it had lost the excess baggage) and a commentary by director Sturla Gunnarsson.

Which pretty much sums up ""Men With Brooms,"" a quirky Canadian comedy that sweeps audiences off its feet (bad curling pun intended).<br />If ""Men With Brooms"" suffers from one particular ailment, it would be that it tries to be a number of different films rolled into one: a love story, a buddy film, a curling documentary of sorts, the quintessential Canadian comedy. But the strength of its original script and ensemble cast really shines. Big name Canadian talent includes Paul Gross (""Due South,"" ""Hamlet"" at Stratford), Molly Parker (""Five Senses,"" ""Rare Birds,"") and Leslie Nielsen (""Due South,"" ""Airplane,"" ""Naked Gun""), although all of the actors do a fantastic job.<br />The basic premise is that Donald Foley, the beloved coach of the Long Bay, Ontario curling team has just died, and in his videotaped will he wants the team to reunite and attempt to win the Golden Broom, the most prestigious award in curling. The skip, Chris Cutter, left town ten years ago after losing an important game and leaving his fiancée Julie, Donald's daughter, standing at the altar. Now he has to attempt the impossible by reuniting his old teammates (a drug dealer, a mortician in a lifeless marriage, and a frustrated husband with a single-digit sperm count) and attempting to win the Golden Broom, as well with making peace with his father (Leslie Neilsen), Julie and himself.<br />In the ""quirky Canadian comedy"" tradition à la ""Rare Birds,"" ""Shipping News,"" and yes, ""Strange Brew,"" ""Men With Brooms"" exalts the quirky charm of the Canadian character. This is evident from the film's opening scene, which pans from a gorgeous shot of the Canadian wilderness to an avant-garde bagpiper (who makes several appearances throughout the film) and a whole lotta computer-generated beavers (yes, beavers!). The film's music, much like that of ""Due South,"" also serves to promote Canadian talent: The Tragically Hip (who also make an appearance as a curling team at the bonspiel), Sarah Harmer, Our Lady Peace, The New Pornographers, Sean McDonald, Big Sugar, Tom Wilson, the Matthew Good Band, Pepper Sands, Chantal Kreviazuk, Holly McNarland, and a beautiful country-rock love ballad by Paul Gross (who has released two albums, ""Two Houses"" and ""Love and Carnage"" as well as contributions to the ""Due South"" soundtracks). A very pleasing film on a number of levels and a darn tootin' lot o' fun, too, eh?!? There is some strong language and a number of implied sexual scenes, so if this offends you consider yourself forewarned. If you love oddball humour, Canadian films, curling or any combination of the three, this film is for you.",[],B00006IUG0,B00006IUG0,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1042595514000,15,False
5.0,An unexpected modern-day Disney classic with a dark side...,"""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" came on the heels of 1995's ""Pocahontas,"" a film which strayed drastically from the traditional Disney style of animation. With ""Hunchback"" Disney staged a breathtaking comeback as the master of animated films: the cathedral of Notre Dame is an imposing, hulking presence in dark stone, with foreboding statues and columns, but touched with beauty, as in the Rose Window sequence that comes at the end of ""God Help the Outcasts."" Clouds and sunsets are palettes of the softest, most realistic colours. The carnival costumes in the Festival of Fools come in all shapes and sizes, and Esmeralda's sheer dancing dress (and her dance) is stunningly drawn (if more than a little suggestive). The grandeur of Notre Dame is awe-inspiring: the careful attention to detail of stonework, statues and especially the Rose Window is breathtaking. ""Hunchback"" may have the most detailed, beautiful artwork of any Disney film.<br />""Hunchback"" boasts a stellar lineup of celebrity vocal talent: Kevin Kline, Demi Moore, Tom Hulce, Jason Alexander, and David Ogden Stiers. Although not as memorable as the scores for ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Pocahontas, the music in ""Hunchback"" is some of the most creative that Disney has attempted, accented with medieval instruments and heavily influenced by Church chants (there are a number of songs with Latin lyrics).  "" The standout song is ""God Help the Outcasts,"" a touching plea for acceptance since we are all ""the children of God.""<br />The character animation is gorgeous and underlines the main theme of the movie, stressing the importance of diversity and being accepted: Esmeralda (Demi Moore) is an exotic vision of femininity and grace, a pleasant departure from the normally Caucascian Disney heroines. Her dark skin, raven hair and emerald eyes smite the hearts of three men (Phoebus, Quasimodo and Frollo). Phoebus (his name means ""sun god"")(Kevin Kline), the Captain of the Guards, is appropriately blond, with golden armor to match, sunlike in his splendour. Quasimodo (Tom Hulce, ""Amadeus"")is all angles, deformed, walks awkwardly, yet somehow he is not repulsive. Judge Claude Frollo (Tony Jay), however, is as evil and corrupt as any Disney villain. His sneers, pursed lips and outright displays of hatred are astonishingly lifelike, and it is quite possible that he will scare younger children.<br />""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" based on the novel by Victor Hugo, has obviously pared down the story for a much younger audience. Certain characters have been cut, with one high-profile example being Gringoire, the homeless poet who serves as narrator in the novel (he too falls under Esmeralda's spell). But several elements of the novel that are crucial to the film are adult in nature: the lust that torments Claude Frollo's soul, displayed rather frighteningly in his song ""Hellfire,"" in which a firey vision of Esmeralda dances suggestively in the fireplace, the love triangle between Quasimodo, Phoebus and Esmeralda, the persecution of the gypsies, and at times the movie is geared more for adults. That is why it is so hard to accept talking, singing gargoyles, since they do not fit in at all with the story and do little to advance the action.<br />But even with its flaws, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" teaches young viewers important lessons about loyalty, love and accepting others who are different. The animation is gorgeous, the songs are more cerebral than most, and the incorporation of Latin chants and church music is a welcome addition.<br />""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" is an intelligent film that does indeed have a dark side, the most adult of any Disney animated film to date. There are moments of suggested sexuality, racial hatred including ethnic cleansing, and struggles to the death that may be frightening to younger children. Although the film does have Christian elements, it does not attempt to preach nor convert. Children will love the animal sidekicks and wisecracking gargoyles, and adults will find plenty of adult humour thrown in that will go completely over the kids' heads. This is one movie that should definitely be watched with your kids for several reasons: you may want to explain some of the action, several of the songs have lyrics with big words, to help soothe fears and tears, and you may find yourself enjoying ""Hunchback"" as well.",[],B00005TN8K,B00005TN8K,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1026352836000,1,False
5.0,"Spirited, unconventional approach to Celtic, folk and more..","I had the great fortune to see Barrage in concert last winter, and I was totally blown away by their high-octane performance. Made up of eight Canadian violinists/dancers/vocalists and additional musicians on percussion and bass, Barrage is brimming with youthful energy. Their music is a blend of Celtic, folk, Eastern, and big band swing, and the eight performers also sing and dance while fiddling.  A blend of Riverdance and Stomp, the concert is interspersed with comments by the various performers. The projected backgrounds are vivid and Celtic-inspired, reminding me once again of Riverdance.<br />Although the DVD label claims that there is a documentary and biography, both claims are misleading. There is a short promo for *a* documentary, and a very brief biography of the band in general. Barrage: The World on Stage is perfect for aspiring stepdancers, fiddlers, violinists, and anyone who loves Celtic music and a rowdy good time (think Canadian family group Leahy).",[],B000056VYN,B000056VYN,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1026167072000,4,False
4.0,Creepy thriller reexamines present-day faith and the Church,"""Stigmata"" is a thought provoking, if sometimes religiously confused, MTVesque journey through the possession/stigmata of Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), a twentysomething atheist raver who suddenly exhibits stigmata (the wounds that Christ received on the cross) after receiving a recently deceased priest's rosary in the mail (her name, combined with later symbolism (the doves feeding from her hands, the statue of St. Francis in the garden), is an obvious nod to St. Francis of Assisi-one of the original working titles was ""St. Frankie of Pittsburgh""). However, director Rupert Wainwright appears fundamentally confused on basic issues, confusing stigmata (which appear to devout Christians) with possession (Frankie speaks in tongues, stabs herself, levitates, and scribbles in Aramaic on the walls).<br />Gabriel Byrne is fantastic (as usual) as Father Andrew Kiernan, an Irish organic chemist turned man of the cloth, who is sent around the globe to investigate bleeding statues and religious sightings. Frankie has an attack in the subway that is witnessed by a priest, and word filters down to the Vatican, where Father Kiernan is hastily reassigned after discovering an authentic bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary in Brazil. Angry at being silenced, Kiernan arrives to find Frankie seeing hallucinations, hearing voices, and sporting some gaping holes in her wrists (the hospital staff fears self-mutilation and suicide attempts) that continue to bleed.<br />The film follows the pair as Frankie's condition deteriorates and the attacks become more violent as another mystery, this one inside the walls of the Vatican, unfolds.  The ""Stigmata"" tagline says it all: the messenger must be silenced. The explanation for the phenomenon is unexpected, as are the two different endings: the theatrical ending and the director's ending. Due to poor test screenings the theatrical ending was substituted, but Wainwright's ending fits in more with the predictions of Father Andrew. There are several deleted scenes, including an alternate opening that explains Father Almeida's death. Factual errors run rampant, including Father Kiernan's assertion that no one had ever received all five stigmata (untrue, St. Francis received all five at once), that St. Francis of Assisi was 23 when he first received the stigmata (he was in his forties), and the fact that Cardinal Houseman wears a goatee (prohibited by the Vatican).<br />The visuals are striking if overwhelming. Multitudes of candles are present in almost every shot, as is water, doves, and blood. The scenes of Frankie receiving the stigmata are almost seizure-inducing-strobe lights, split-second flashes of nails being hammered into wrists, Frankie's bloodied face from several angles, all without transitions, rushed and drowned in a hard-rock soundtrack (the visuals alone built up a sufficient atmosphere of foreboding; the hard rock was overkill) penned by Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan. Sinead O'Connor and the Afro-Celt Sound System contribute, as does Natalie Imbruglia, and David Bowie.<br />""Stigmata"" is entertaining, although it is extremely violent, gory, contains graphic sex, and is easily religiously offensive. There really is no Satanic demonic possession, rather something using Frankie as a messenger for good (albeit with extreme Machiavellian means).  The movie casts a less than flattering light on the Catholic Church and the Vatican, and seems to glorify Frankie's hedonistic lifestyle. But the stigmata and Father Kiernan inevitably leave a large impact on Frankie's life, Frankie, who was once so self-assured in her partying ways and the non-existence of God. As the messenger she utters these words from the gospel of St. Thomas: ""The kingdom of God is within you and all around you. It is not within buildings of wood or stone. Split a piece of wood and you will find me. Look beneath a stone and I am there."" Although at times it looks like an outtake from Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"" video, ""Stigmata"" is thought provoking and visually stunning.",[],6305718954,6305718954,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1026006920000,3,False
5.0,A magical family film that brings Ireland home....,"""Into the West"" is an underrated jewel of Irish filmmaking that follows a rather unconventional storyline: a down-and-out father, Papa Reilly, (Gabriel Byrne), leads a miserable existence in a Dublin slum along with his two young sons.  The poverty and bleakness is overwhelming and not what one would expect from a Disney film (which it is).  Starving children sing on streetcorners for money, fathers drink away the welfare money, and education and sanitary conditions seem alien. This is not the Ireland of ""The Quiet Man"" or even ""The Secret of Roan Inish.""<br />Papa Reilly is a traveller, or gypsy, although he has forsaken the old ways after his wife's death. His father-in-law tries to convince him in vain to return to the roads, but Reilly stands firm, insolently refusing all help. His two sons Tito and Ossie fall in love with a mysterious white horse that has followed their grandfather's caravan, and the two claim Tir na Nog as their own (but the horse had claimed them first). The lines between fantasy and reality are blurred, and this is not just a children's film, nor is it solely for an older audience. It is hybrid of mythology and magic much like ""The Secret of Roan Inish,"" another Irish fairytale of a film that also dealt with magical animals (in that case seals).<br />The rest of the movie requires suspension of disbelief, including several improbable chase scenes, but the heartwarming stories of the two boys coming to terms with their past (their mother's death, their father's alcoholism) and forging stronger bonds of brotherhood, and the grieving father and widower coming to terms with his loss and resolving to start a new life with his sons as the king of the travellers once more, truly make this a touching and unforgettable film.<br />The scenery is beautiful, from the bleak, grey Dublin slums to the gently sloping western mountains, spectacular craggy cliffs and crashing seaspray. The soundtrack is a blend of Irish music old and new, with contributions from Black 47, the Rankin Family and Clannad. Patrick Doyle (""Shipwrecked"") composed the score, which uses Irish instruments and haunting Irish Gaelic vocals to build atmosphere.<br />There are several tense moments during action sequences which may prove frightening to younger children, but nothing overly objectionable in ""Into The West."" Younger children may find it a bit slow and hard to follow, but patience is truly a virtue in the case of this magical film.",[],6303066712,6303066712,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1026002384000,99,False
5.0,Moving story of Jesus's message in a modern reincarnation...,"« J&eacute;sus de Montr&eacute;al » was a stunning, thought-provoking film by Montr&eacute;alais director Denys Arcand. The strong ensemble cast includes Lothaire Bluteau (""Le confessional,"" ""La robe noire"") and Robert Lepage (famous Qu&eacute;bec playwright, author of ""Nô,"" and ""The Seven Streams of the River Ota""). The story revolves around a series of actors: Constance (who works in a soup kitchen, plays Mary Magdalene and sleeps with the priest), Mireille (a sexy young actress whose sole talent, according to her ex, is in her backside), Martin and R&eacute;n&eacute;, actors who dub porno films in French, and Daniel (Bluteau), a fragile young actor enlisted to play Jesus in a popular passion play. Bluteau is frail and androgynous to a certain degree, lending him an angelic quality. He is extremely soft-spoken and I often had to turn the volume up to hear him. His voice was barely above a whisper in many of the passion play scenes and near the end.<br />Daniel does extensive research into the life and times of Jesus, taking into account new archaeological findings. Instead of merely ""updating"" the passion play he, along with his fellow actors, rewrites it. Jesus is the son of a Roman soldier in the play, the crucifixion is performed accurately (naked, with the torso twisted to the side), and the Catholic priests are upset and demand an end to the passion play on the mount. Martin works in his Hamlet soliloquy ""To sleep...perchance to dream..."" in a scene that is strangely powerful as the resurrected Jesus comes to the disciples.<br />The normally mild mannered Daniel rebels at the treatment Mireille receives at an audition, and mirroring Jesus' disruption of the moneylenders in the temple in Matthew 21:12 (""And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of he money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves."") Daniel becomes irrational when the casting director (Mireille's ex-boyfriend) tells her to strip. Daniel orders her to refuse, then, flying into a rage knocks over tables, smashes cameras and monitors and causes thousands of dollars worth of damage. His life begins to mirror that of Jesus.<br />Lothaire Bluteau was the only choice for the role of Daniel/ Jesus. He becomes so involved in all of his roles that he walks a dangerous line. Robert Lepage says that he embodies and expresses emotional pain better than any actor in the world. Lothaire Bluteau says of himself that he still is struggling to learn to live with the searing pain he feels for real. According to a recent interview, ""In person, the theatrical, charismatic, deeply analytical and cathartic Bluteau wears many emotional scars beneath his pale and skeletal physical armour. His immersion into the characters that have inhabited not only his physical being, but his emotional thoughts and each waking moment are the very extension of himself into some intangible realms. He readily admits that these fictional characters are always awaiting his presence to fill them and breathe life into their troubled existences."" Ask Bluteau if he finds it difficult to achieve a separation point between the characters her portrays and himself and he frowns: ""Sometimes I think I'm getting better at not drowning in the emotional sadness and the fear I have when I start working on a film or play. When you are enriched by your characters life, you do tend to share a lot of things together. They will call upon your emotions and leave you with souvenirs and old scars, that you manage to survive from. The character wants to borrow that pain, and of course there is a transformation and collar of sadness that you are attached to."" So he is ultimately believable as a modern-day Jesus, preaching to the crowds at a Montr&eacute;al subway station, chasing the ""money lenders"" out of the studio, and finally sacrificing his life so that others may live through him. The final scenes are unspeakably powerful as Daniel's message lives on.<br />There are moments of humour as well, irreverence towards Catholic doctrine and its unwillingness to change. When the priest informs them that they have to revert to the original script, Martin, R&eacute;n&eacute;, Constance and Mireille begin an absurdly funny ad-lib update of the passion play. First Constance recites a line and makes it sound like a line from a porno dub, then Mireille turns it into une com&eacute;die française, Martin tries New York method acting, R&eacute;n&eacute; vulgar joual, and Martin and R&eacute;n&eacute; do a Kabuki version that had me in tears. It was the funniest thing I had seen in years. There are similar lighthearted moments between the actors/friends, but much of the story has a sombre tone.<br />The cinematography is spectacular, with enticing shots of Montr&eacute;al at work and at play. The nighttime scenes are particularly effective, as are the passion play scenes. The music is sparse but haunting: an aria from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater that is sung at the end over the credits, and during the passion play we hear haunting music from Le myst&egrave;re des voix bulgares. There is some nudity, although it is not sexual. There is a lot of offensive language, especially during the improv passion play, and during the porno dubbing scene (which is hilarious in a sad way). This is not a film for those who are devoutly religious or easily offended. The film is subtitled in English (with French subtitles over the English dialogue).<br /><br />« J&eacute;sus de Montr&eacute;al » explores the story of Jesus, updates it, gives it a fresh young face in the form of Daniel. What would happen if Jesus reappeared in the world today? Denys Arcand explores this through multiple Biblical parallels and imagery and a stellar supporting cast, also using the film as a vehicle to express his distaste of the all-consuming media and material greed. We see the transformation of a group of ordinary actors into Biblical beings who are profoundly changed by Daniel's/Jesus's presence in their lives. This film will leave you thinking for hours afterwards.",[],B00000IQCC,B00000IQCC,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1018406323000,12,False
5.0,The first (and best) music DVD in my collection,"""Sarah McLachlan: Video Collection 1989-1998"" was my first DVD. I received it as a present from a friend who shared my passion for Sarah McLachlan's music and artistic vision.<br />The DVD features fifteen music videos spanning all four of Sarah's studio albums (Touch, Solace, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing). The earliest, Vox, dates from 1988 and we see then-20-year-old Sarah as fresh-faced and angelic. The directorial tastes of some of the earlier videos are questionably cheesy, with Vox (Canadian version) being one of the most New Wave-stuck in the '80s mode. The picture quality is generally very sharp, with crisp blacks and vibrant colours. It is a pleasure to see Sarah's maturation as an artist and the directions that her music would take.<br />One of my favourite videos is ""Steaming,"" a pseudo-film noir club scene reminiscent of Anita Kelsey's songs in the sci-fi film ""Dark City."" Sarah is a lounge singer, a temptress, with ardent eyes and gloved hands caressing the old-fashioned stand microphone. Her burning gaze bores a hole into you as the story in the video acts itself out.<br />Other notable videos include ""Drawn to the Rhythm,"" a Loreena McKennittesque video full of surreal images and shot in black and white. The simple, haunting beauty of Sarah's voice and acoustic guitar combined with the wavelike rhythm and images of the ocean make this one tread on New Age/Celtic territory &agrave; la McKennitt and Kate Price.<br />""Possession"" is full of muddled religious imagery: Adam and Eve, the severed head of John the Baptist, an actor portraying Christ, as well as blends of pagan imagery (witches/seductress).<br />""Into the Fire"" is a very catchy song with a rather creepy video: naked, mud-coated Sarah rolling around in mud and soggy leaves. Ick. I felt grimy just watching it!<br />The last few videos from Surfacing really show Sarah's new image and darker songs. ""Building a Mystery"" features a mysterious man collecting stars and lights and sewing them onto a skirt (this is the top picture on the DVD case), and slipping into a crawl space that Sarah follows him into. ""Sweet Surrender"" is a bit more disturbing: a victim of a hit-and-run or an accident, apparently dead, mimes along to the music. The body mysteriously moves from the middle of the road, where we see it hit by a car, to the backseat of said car, then is carried into a house and placed on a chesterfield. Sarah and the ""body"" duet and mimick each other's actions. ""Adia"" is a neat study in still photography.<br />This is the perfect gift for that Sarah McLachlan fan. Lots of fun even the third and fourth time through. The variety of musical styles and directorial choices in the various videos make this a pleasure to come back to again and again! I can't wait until Sarah McLachlan's new album comes out..it's been five years since Surfacing. Work on the new CD was suspended for six months due to the severe illness of Sarah McLachlan's mother and Sarah's pregnancy (Sarah gave birth to daughter India on April 6, 2002. Congratulations Sarah and Ashwin!). There's a 75% chance that it will be released sometime in 2002, with the single being released an unheard-of 16 weeks in advance.<br />Here is the tracklisting for ""Sarah McLachlan: Video Collection 1989-1998"":<br />1.

5.0,A sleeper of astonishing colour and beauty,"""The Man Who Cried"" is a feast for the eyes and ears alike. One recent review called it ""the art-house companion to Moulin Rouge,"" and that doesn't seem too far off. The film begins with Fegele and her father in 1927 Russia, with a beautifully photographed game of hide and seek. Fearing for his family's safety, her father sends her away to America, but Fegele ends up in England by mistake, is renamed Suzie and is raised by a grim British couple. The scenes of the Russian shtetl are grim, and colour truly doesn't become pronounced until we see the cabaret shows of Paris, the gaudy costumes and headdresses and the opera sets.<br />Suzie (Christina Ricci) runs into fellow showgirl Lola (Cate Blanchett) and the two room together, locking horns over Italian sensation Dante, the main draw at the theatre, who also happens to be a fascist. Lola gets her way and her man. Enter one very mysterious, brooding Gypsy horseman (Johnny Depp, reprising his role from Chocolat) who captures Suzie's heart. This entire whirlwind of music, passion and drama occurs on the eve of World War Two, and Suzie is in danger of being discovered as Jewish.<br />The cinematography is gorgeous, with washed-out colours in Russia, beautiful cityscapes of Paris (especially the bike/horse chase at night!), gaudily bright costumes and opera sets, the exotic colour, music and flair of the Gypsy camp and costumes. The colour brings to mind the brilliant Technicolour prints of the earlier days, with vibrant, surreal colours.<br />The soundtrack is equally stunning, with contributions by newcomer Italian tenor Salvatore Licitra, the Kronos Quartet, the Gypsy ensemble Taraf de Haidouks, and Czech songstress Iva Bittova providing the voice for Christina Ricci. The operatic selections by Bizet, Puccini, Purcell, and Verdi are balanced by original score (the stunning ""Close Your Eyes"" is the most beautiful song in the movie) and frantic Gypsy music. Bittova's ""Gloomy Sunday"" is a delightful study in atmosphere, and appropriately sets the tone for an onscreen event near the end of the film.<br />""The Man Who Cried"" is an unusual, beautiful, and touching glimpse at a decadent Europe on the brink of war, the vibrant Gypsy culture, the Jewish shtetls of Russia, and the world of opera, all intertwined with romance and connections to the past.",[],B00005R87R,B00005R87R,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1017630850000,234,False
5.0,A gripping tale of love and loss on an Ontario reserve....,"""Dance Me Outside"" was a fantastic Canadian film from 1994 based on the novel of the same name by W.P. Kinsella. Directed by Bruce McDonald and co-written by Don McKellar (""Last Night,"" ""The Red Violin""), the film centers around Frank Fencepost and Silas Crow, two young adults on a reserve in northern Ontario, planning on going to college in Toronto to become mechanics. We are introduced early on to their family and (girl)friends, and the tragic act that sets the tone occurs early on in the film. ""Dance Me Outside"" inspired the (Canadian) TV series ""The Rez"" (1996) which featured many of the same actors and characters (Frank, Silas, Sadie, Joseph, Etta).<br />The film opens with a shot of Silas Crow crouched down staring at his namesake, accompanied by a native flute and a voiceover. Throughout the film there are ties between the spiritual and the natural, whether it is Illiana's mother telling her that babies come from the Great Spirit or the predictions of Mad Etta. The scenes of Robert McVey, Illiana's white Torontonian yuppie lawyer husband, being ""initiated"" into the tribe as a ruse for Gooch (Illiana's old flame who was just released from jail) to impregnate Illiana, border on the absurd, representing white stereotypes of First Nations and vice versa, but there is a power, a lack of inhibition and an attempt to become one with nature, that makes it moving.<br />""Dance Me Outside"" features many talented First Nations actors: Adam Beach (who was also in the award-winning ""Smoke Signals""), Ryan Rajendra Black, Jennifer Podemski, Michael Greyeyes, Selim Running Bear Sandoval, and Vince Manitowabi among them.<br />The music was equally excellent, from a variety of bands such as Kashtin, the Vern Cheechoo Band, Joanne Shenandoah, the Headstones, Keith Secola, and R. Carlos Nakai.<br />In some ways I preferred this film to the much-hyped ""Smoke Signals"" based on the strength of the screenplay, the cinematography, and the realistic depiction and treatment of current First Nations social issues. There is some violence, vandalism, nudity, and swearing, but this is a touching, powerful film about community, strength, love and tradition.",[],6304137168,6304137168,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1016582175000,41,False
4.0,Gripping heist film mixed with smooth Montréal jazz,"In all honesty, I originally rented ""The Score"" just to see the location footage of Montréal. I hadn't read any reviews because I wanted the film to surprise me, and boy, it did! I was completely impressed with the rapport between De Niro, Norton and Brando as well as the appearance by Gary Farmer. As many have said before me, Angela Basset's screen time was limited to something like 10 minutes more or less, but she did a fantastic job as Nick's girlfriend--saucy, yet devoted, someone Nick can trust in and rely on, a rarity in his *other* field of work besides owning a jazz club.<br />The cinematography was superb, from creative Steadicam shots (walking through the narrow, narrow door to Nick's tool room in the intro, panning around cars) to fantastic reflection shots (the Customs House). Much emphasis is placed on smoky, atmospheric lighting, with shadows playing a crucial role in charater development (as Jack, Nick and Max talk, all three are equally cast in shadow so as not to single any one of them out as the potential ""winner takes all"").<br />The music is equally impressive, including solid, sultry jazz performances by Diana Krall, G Club, Cannonball Adderly, Cassandra Wilson, Thelonious Monk, Mose Allison, and others. Unfortunately, none of these songs are included on the ""The Score"" soundtrack. But they make the atmosphere of Nick's NYC Montréal Jazz Club spring to life--smoky lights and cool blue jazz as a contrast to the tense heist scenes.<br />All of the actors do incredible work with their roles, especially De Niro and Norton. Norton's double character of Brian/Jack was certainly a surprise. I did not think that he was being overly disrespectful to the mentally retarded--I have read reviews that stated it as such, but Jack was merely playing a role.<br />De Niro certainly appeared to be the tortured thief, torn between his wanting to settle down with Diane and run his jazz club and that one last shot at glory that he goes for time and time again. ""How many times have you said that in 25 years?"" asks Max (Brando) when Nick says he's quitting for the umpteenth time. But Frank Oz's masterpiece shows us his dilemna in the silences and the shadows that surround Nick.<br />The DVD interactive menus were user friendly and graphically impressive at the same time, starting off with an explosion of sparks accompanied by the sound of a watch ticking and counting down. I was a little disappointed with the ""extra"" features: a theatrical trailer, a director's commentary with Frank Oz and Rob Hahn (which did have its interesting moments, but like so many commentaries there are long stretches of silence and totally irrelevant information), the ""making of"" (which was more a recap of movie footage than actual ""making of"", and additional scenes (one improv with Brando and De Niro at the bar, an alternate coffee shop scene with Norton and De Niro and a longer scene with Mose Allison singing ""City Home.""<br />Minor gripes: De Niro and Brando's French---aaaarrgh. That's all I can say. I cringed, I covered my ears...I actually switched the audio to French and listened to most of the film that way. That is a neat feature seeing as the film *is* in Montréal, and some of the actors are francophone to begin with. The French dubbing was excellently done and followed very closely to the original script.<br />Lots of swearing, no nudity and no sex, some tense moments. The hacker character strongly reminded me of Burns Flipper from the PC game ""The Longest Journey""--totally stressed out, mentally unstable, obsessed with technology and both were compulsive swearaholics.<br />""The Score"" is a wonderful character/heist movie with a great setting (Montréal), a killer jazz soundtrack, and three generations of stellar acting talent (Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton). If you're looking for something new, something with a smoky,mysterious atmosphere and genuine white-knuckle-remote-clenching tension, pick up ""The Score""!

5.0,"Fry bread, John Wayne's teeth, and storytelling.....","&quot;Smoke Signals&quot; was the first movie to be written, directed, and co-produced by a Native American. It is based on the novel &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven&quot; by Sherman Alexie, who also published a movie adaptation of &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; as well.<br />The majority of the cast is from a variety of Canadian First Nations tribes (Coast Salish, Cree, Cayuga, Ojibwa), so there are different cultural backgrounds at work as well. &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; is a journey of the heart, an exploration of what it means to be Indian, venturing into the world outside the rez. Thomas's stories are part Indian legend, part reweaving of the facts surrounding Victor and his father.<br />The story follows Victor Joseph as he goes to collect the remains of his father, who had abandoned his family and moved to Arizona (the film's working title was &quot;This Is What It Means To Say Phoenix, Arizona,&quot; based on a chapter of &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.&quot; His wise friend Thomas Builds-the-Fire goes with him on a trip from their rez in Coeur-d'Alene, Idaho to Arnold Joseph's trailer in Arizona. Along the way they rediscover their pasts and their perceptions of the world around them.<br />An unusual, touching film that pokes fun at the stoic Indian stereotypes endorsed by Hollywood for decades, such as the &quot;It's a good day to die&quot; line. There are many notable First Nations actors (Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Tantoo Cardinal, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Elaine Miles) that make this film a joy to watch. Inspired performances from all, especially Adam Beach and Gary Farmer. This is my favourite film of the last few years as it never loses its humour, mystical side, and beauty.",[],6305428417,6305428417,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1011464658000,119,False
5.0,A tasty French fairy tale....,"&quot;Chocolat&quot; proved to be my favourite film of 2000. Based closely upon the novel by Joanne Harris, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is much like a fairy tale. It possesses the same sense of magic and whimsy, and the added bonus of beaucoup de.... scrumptious chocolate in every shape and form: moulded nudes, suns, Aztec temples, nipples of Venus, thick hot chocolate with cream.... all of these delicacies, when paired with Vianne's (Juliette Binoche) kindess and knack for guessing favourite chocolates, change the townspeople profoundly.<br />&quot;Chocolat&quot; is a simple, delicious tale of the human heart, of the value of laughter, compassion, and chocolate of course. The DVD does have a making-of featurette and a few deleted scenes, one of which should have been left in the film (Armande's letter to Vianne) as it clarified and added a great deal of meaning. The feature on the film's costumes was also interesting. If you are a fan of romantic comedy/drama, period films (post WWII rural France), or chocolate, this is a wonderful little film in the tradition of &quot;Como agua para chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate)&quot; that blends romance and magic with culinary delights.",[],B00005K3OT,B00005K3OT,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1010926919000,3,True
5.0,A deliciously Tolkienesque fantasy,"&quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was a Jim Henson masterpiece, a skilful marriage of technology and art, a dark, unique creative vision that I believe is superior to &quot;Labyrinth.&quot; The characters are non-human puppets and animatronics, one reason why audiences found it hard to relate to the protagonists Jen and Kira. It has been called &quot;a flawed masterpiece,&quot; but in my eyes it is one of the best fantasy movies ever made. I tried to read all of the Tolkien novels, but this kept my attention far longer and shared some of the same elements (good versus evil, mythical beings, power struggles between ruling clans).<br />Still as fresh and unique as when it was released in 1982, this DVD edition features fantastic extras that enhance the viewing experience, such as a 50 minute documentary of the making of &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; an isolated soundtrack (Trevor Jones' score is gorgeous...this way you get a soundtrack and a DVD at the same time (the original soundtrack is now out-of-print). There are two deleted scenes and original language working prints of the Skeksis. This is the ultimate version of the ultimate fantasy tale.

5.0,"An enduring tale of love, courage and trust","Don Bluth's &quot;The Secret Of NIMH,&quot; based upon the novel &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH,&quot; was released in 1982 and was quickly forgotten at the box office in favour of Steven Spielberg's E.T. (which was released around the same time). I picked this up for less than ten dollars on DVD and I haven't stopped playing it since. It has been at least fifteen years since I had last seen it, and I enjoy it more than ever.<br />Bluth and close to two dozen Disney animators defected from Disney's studios in favour of having a chance to express and explore their artistic visions and creativity. One of their first animated films was &quot;The Secret of NIMH.&quot; Other Bluth films include &quot;Anastasia,&quot; and &quot;An American Tail.&quot; But no other animated film captures the sense of magic and wonder like &quot;The Secret of NIMH.&quot;<br />Mrs. Brisby, a recently widowed field mouse, tries desperately to protect her invalid son Timothy from Moving Day, when the farmer's plough will destroy their underground home. She is led to a colony of superintelligent rats, ex-subjects of laboratory experiments at the National Institute of Mental Health. They are led by wise old Nicodemus, a friend of Mrs. Brisby's late husband Jonathan, also an escaped lab mouse from NIMH.<br />The somewhat dark tale does feature light-hearted comedic relief in the form of Jeremy, a trouble-prone young crow voiced by Dom Deluise. The story sticks fairly close to the book version, although several new elements are added and some side plots are cut due to time restraints. The artwork is breathtaking; vibrant backgrounds, clever special effects, the play of light and shadow. The characters are real and you quickly become attached to them. No one breaks into song every five minutes, although there is a very beautiful lullaby on the soundtrack that Mrs. Brisby sings to Timothy.<br />To me, this film is deeper, darker, and more imaginative than anything that Disney has produced. There are no fancy CGI effects, only the skilful work of animators that love what they do. The film carries a message of courage, love, and trust without being preachy or simple. There are plenty of tense, dark scenes, some of which might upset smaller children. But &quot;Secret of NIMH&quot; is a beautiful, intelligent movie that is so much more than a cartoon or a children's fable.",[],6305161887,6305161887,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1009333282000,3,False
5.0,Sweeping epic offers a musical Chinese history lesson.,"I rented &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; last fall after reading many positive reviews on Amazon.com and other film sites. I have always been a fan of Chinese music, especially opera, and I watch Peking Operas on TV every week. Having a whole movie revolve around the dizzying world of Peking Opera was a brilliant idea. All of the performances are astounding, especially from Leslie Cheung. Granted, Chinese Opera is an acquired taste, the feminine parts sung by males in a very nasal falsetto.<br />But &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is more than just a musical legacy. It is a tale of friendship, loyalty, passion and betrayal on a grand scale, including the attempted destruction of Chinese Opera during the Cultural Revolution. My only complaint is the scenes of the two actors in &quot;present day&quot; China...they do not seem any older than when we first saw them as twentysomethings even though they would be forty years older. But this is an excellent movie, although long and very intense in some spots (rape, suicide, drug use). It certainly gave me new respect for Peking Opera and the sacrifices that were made in the name of music.",[],B00002RAPT,B00002RAPT,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1006823513000,15,False
5.0,"Hey kid, you'll shoot your eye out!","&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; has been a part of my holiday tradition for the last ten years. This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit year-round! All Ralphie Parker wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. Ah, if life were that simple. His 1940's Midwest family is humorously dysfunctional: his father stumbles around yelling garbled curses at the malfunctioning furnace and worshipping &quot;The Leg Lamp,&quot; his little brother Randy is an annoying nuisance whose sole ability seems to be whining, and all the grownups in his life don't take him seriously. Throw in some school bullies, a wild imagination, and plenty of Christmas spirit, and you end up with the wonderful mix that is &quot;A Christmas Story.&quot; Every year my family will gather around the TV, with a fire in the fireplace and glasses of eggnog. We usually watch this at least three times a year: after Thanksgiving, on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day. There is something magical about returning to the trials and tribulations of childhood, of the yearning and pleading and begging after that one Christmas gift that you HAVE to have, the sacred ritual of visiting Santa Claus at the mall, choosing that perfect Christmas tree (even if it ends up looking like Charlie Brown's), that first magical snowfall, the whole family decorating the tree, waiting for Santa and finally running down the stairs about as quietly as an elephant on Christmas morning in the quest to be the first to unwrap the presents in a frenzy of knotted ribbons and flying wrapping paper (hopefully NOT finding a pink bunny costume like poor Ralphie). This is a gentle, heartwarming, humorous tale of Christmas. It is rated PG due to minor swear words (and a narrowly averted major swear word)... and an imaginary shootout with BB guns. But it is a movie for kids and parents alike that celebrates family and the wondrous holiday known as Christmas.

5.0,A celluloid tribute to a vanished way of life....,"The circus sideshow was an American phenomenon for decades, satisfying the public's need to be scared, disgusted, and left in disbelief. Attractions were more and more preposterous, but many of the performers in &quot;Freaks&quot; were memories of sideshows past. Sideshows were one of the few options for the severly deformed, a chance to make money while developing &quot;family&quot; ties with other sideshow performers. Politically correct it was not, but it was an alternative to life in an instititution.<br />TLC did a two-hour program called &quot;Sideshow&quot; narrated by Jason Alexander that chronicles the history of sideshows in the United States. There is footage of &quot;Freaks&quot; that is discussed as well as interviews with many surviving sideshow attractions such as Jeanie the Half Girl.<br />&quot;Freaks&quot; was made by Dracula director Tod Browning on a seemingly low budget. The electrical equipment on the set was so badly grounded that crew members were frequently shocked. Here are several interesting trivia tidbits surrounding the film: the film's original ending showed Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow, but due to intense test audience reactions this scene was cut. Randion, the man with no arms or legs, developed a habit of lurking in dark corners and frightening passers-by with a blood-curdling yell. And during filming, the director was plagued with dreams in which Johnny Eck and a pinhead would keep bringing a cow in backward through a doorway in the middle of shoots.<br />This film was so disturbing to the public that it was banned in Britain for thirty years. It went under alternate titles including &quot;Forbidden Love,&quot; &quot;The Monster Show,&quot; and &quot;Nature's Mistakes.&quot; The &quot;freaks&quot; are still just as unsettling as they must have been to the sideshow and film public in 1932: a Half-Woman Half Man, a Half Boy, The Living Human Skeleton, The Bearded Lady, the Bird Girl, the Living Torso, the Armless Wonder, Pinheads, a Bird Girl and a Turtle Girl. Some are obviously mentally impared (pinheads and the bird girl)and their uninhibited bizzare performances are even scarier than the other acts.<br />&quot;Freaks&quot; still gives me the chills years after the first time I saw it. It is a testament to mankind's everlasting attraction to the bizarre, the scream-inducing, and the macabre. It is a remembrance of the once-booming sideshow business with its ragtag collection of &quot;human oddities.&quot; And it's a pretty creepy horror film as well. I wouldn't recommend this to young children...it is not gory or violent but the images ARE disturbing even to me. But's it's a great Halloween film and an interesting piece of circus history captured for all to experience decades after its decline. Watch it in the dark....",[],B00005JH9W,B00005JH9W,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,1003414642000,3,False
5.0,How do you measure a year in the life?,"For any of you Rentheads out there, yes, the title of my Philadelphia review is from the musical Rent, more specifically the song &quot;Seasons of Love.&quot; I saw the musical Rent before I saw Philadelphia and some of the same basic human emotions and reactions regarding AIDS, homosexuality and mortality that are in RENT apply equally well to Philadelphia. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; follows the journey of lawyer Andrew Beckett as he sues his firm for firing him on the grounds of discrimination. The catch: Beckett is gay and is in the final stages of AIDS.<br />We see Beckett as a capable lawyer, compassionate, determined to make a change in the world. He hides the telltale KS (Kaposi's Sarcoma) lesions on his face from his coworkers with makeup but he is noticeably thin and fatigued. Suffering from severe chronic diarrhea as a result of KS and AZT, he is taken to the hospital where we first meet his longtime companion Miguel (Antonio Banderas), a rather headstrong yet tender lover who is fiercely devoted to Andy. Later we meet Joe Miller, the lawyer that we first see Andy arguing a case against in the beginning of the film. Miller is a stereotypical &quot;ambulance chaser&quot; with the prerequisite cheesy TV ads. He is also an extreme homophobe and is fearful of HIV. Throughout the film Joe Miller learns to accept Andy for the goodhearted, decent person that he is and the fragility of all life. He does not agree with Andy's lifestyle but does not want to abandon him, knowing that in his condition Andy could never defend himself.<br /> The months pass quickly, and Andy's deterioration is frighteningly rapid. His hair thins and turns grey, he requires blood transfusions, he is gaunt and grey and suffers from frequent respiratory infections. He knows that he will die soon and tries to face death with dignity, echoing the lyrics from the RENT song &quot;Will I?&quot;: 'Will I lose my dignity Will someone care Will I wake tomorrow From this nightmare?' Andy's fears and his love for life are beautifully expressed during a monologue set to the aria &quot;La Momma Morta&quot; performed by Maria Callas. Miguel wants Andy to start writing a will and planning for his memorial, but instead Andy throws a &quot;celebration of life&quot; party for himself and his friends (mostly homosexuals with the exception of Joe Miller and his wife. Joe handles the occasion beautifully considering his intensive dislike of homosexuality).<br />Andy is attacked from within and without: AIDS ravages his body while lawyer Belinda Conine (Mary Steenburgen) tries to rip apart his credibility and personal life on the witness stand and in the court. Andy is made to confess his past mistakes that have ultimately and unknowingly cost him his career and his life: his past visits to a gay pornography theatre, at least one anonymous sexual encounter at said theatre (interestingly enough this occurred 10 years earlier when he was still with Miguel, yet Miguel was not infected, suggesting that this act was a momentary lapse in judgment rather than an habitual act). This admittance to Andy's having sex with a stranger and contracting AIDS is used against him, showing that he was a threat and could have infected Miguel and other partners with AIDS. Miguel watches, tortured, from the bench. Andy is increasingly ill and frail in the courtroom and eventually collapses. Inevitably Andy dies in hospital with Miguel at his side.<br />Antonio Banderas is absolutely amazing in his role as Miguel--the slow dance with Andy at the party, the arguments at home, the anguish and tenderness in his eyes as he kisses Andy's fingers, the only part of him not tubed, as Andy is dying. His eyes reflect so much love for Andy, fear of losing him, pain at seeing the agony he lives through every day with AIDS. He has been with him for a decade, and suddenly mundane moments take on new meaning as there will not be others to follow. He too must face Andy's mortality, and he appears outwardly gruff and argumentative. He must appear courageous for Andy's sake and his own or he would become lost in his grief.<br />In my opinion this is the definitive role of Tom Hanks' lifetime. Andy is an ordinary man: a devoted lover, a decent, honest person, and an outstanding lawyer. He tries to do what is right, what he believes in, to be proud of himself and his accomplishments. Tom Hanks brings a wisdom and tenderness to the role that makes him ultimately believable and not just a victim. Just a glance from Hanks, a word, a gesture, conveys more about Andy than pages of dialogue ever could. The loving glances between Miguel and Andy and Andy and his family, his look of hopelessness as he stands on the street after being refused by Joe Miller, his face as he is on trial, sick and alone and having to defend his actions from the past. He faces injustice and loss with courage. Tom Hanks becomes Andy, going through a physical and spiritual transformation that touches our souls.<br />This movie does an excellent job of covering both the treatment of homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. during the early 1990's. Because it is a mainstream film it shies away from certain elements, mainly more physical contact and scenes between Miguel and Andy, and focuses more on Joe Miller's gradual acceptance of AIDS and Andy's homosexuality. There are many scenes involving fear and hatred directed at homosexuals and offensive language and jokes. But &quot;Philadelphia&quot; has something meaningful to say about the power of love and support in times of need, about understanding and being tolerant of alternative lifestyles, and about accepting the inevitability of death with grace and courage. An excellent film, touching and thought-provoking.",[],0800141806,0800141806,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,999053644000,7,False
5.0,Thought-provoking Canadian masterpiece.,"&quot;The Five Senses&quot; is a profound film about what it means to be human, and about the loss of innocence and the yearning for touch, for comfort, for love. Set in Toronto, it follows the lives of around a dozen characters over a three-day period. The central theme is based on the exploration of the five senses and how these senses or lack of them influence our lives. The main premise is that a toddler has gone missing while under the care of a masseuse's alienated daughter.<br />The film follows the lives of the people who live in the same building as well as the people that are related to the missing child. Rona, the baker who turns out gorgeous cakes that have no taste and her Italian live-in boyfriend Roberto, an aspiring chef, represent taste. Richard, a French opthamalogist who is going deaf and Gail, a prostitute that he has hired to listen to music with him, explore sound and its absence. 16-year old Rachel is deeply alienated and confused. There are hints to sexual abuse when she was younger, she dropped out of school, and along with her newfound friend Rupert she explores voyeurism and gender roles, representing sight. Robert is a bisexual housecleaner who is desperate for &quot;the right one,&quot; so much so that he meets with former lovers to sniff them, believing he has the ability to smell love. Ruth is a widowed masseuse and the mother of Rachel. She has the ability to use touch to soothe others but longs for comfort herself.<br />For me the most touching story was that of Richard. Having my life revolve around music I have often pondered what would happen if I began to lose my hearing. It is one of the most frightening things that I can think of. Richard makes lists of seemingly ordinary things (thunder, trains, birds) that he wants to listen to one last time in order to catalogue them in his mind. He even calls his daughter in order to tape her voice so he can listen to it again and again. He hires the prostitute Gail to listen to music with him, and with deep tenderness she helps him cope with his advancing hearing loss.<br />All of the stories are engaging and overlap occasionally. Some of the background details are left sketchy or occasionally absent, but the viewer is left with enough to piece together. This is a movie that requires thinking. It is not a Hollywood fairytale by any means; it is not wrapped neatly and tied with a bow. It is real life, things and people that we know instinctively. The cinematography is stark, with many shadows and cold lighting. It captures the feel of Toronto in fall perfectly, but also highlights the emotional and physical isolation of the characters in the film.<br />My favourite part in the film is when Rachel, returning home after crossdressing Rupert, finally gets a glimpse of the mysterious singer that was heard throughout the film. Ruth briefly mentioned this to Richard, saying that no one had ever seen her. But Rachel, after exploring gender roles and sexuality, peers through a crack and sees a beautiful man standing alone singing with the voice of an angel, showing that beauty is not confined to male or female but that it transcends gender. This singer is Daniel Taylor, one of my two favourite countertenors. His appearance is very brief but his voice and his music helps tie the film together, linking Richard and Rachel in their quest for beauty. Taylor is Canada's most famous countertenor and one of the best in the world. I actually rented this film just to see him in it and I wasn't disappointed.<br /> For me the music to this film is exquisite. Much of it is baroque, polyphonic, medieval, and one John Dowland Renaissance song with four Spanish songs thrown in. Daniel Taylor performs &quot;Amarilli mia bella&quot; and &quot;Come to my window.&quot; Below you will find the listing of songs used in the film. There are some scenes involving nudity and sexual themes (voyeurism, crossdressing) and some strong language. But overall this film made me think more than any other film I've seen in the last ten years. And that's a good thing.",[],B00003CXMJ,B00003CXMJ,AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA,998966566000,19,False
5.0,Darkly satisfying......,"Let me begin by saying that I have not read the book and am judging the movie solely on its own merits. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is a luscious, guilty pleasure of modern filmmaking, visually resplendent and with wonderful performances by all (including Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea). It follows the adventures of Louis de Pont du Lac (Brad Pitt), a 200-year-old vampire hailing from Louisiana, as he recounts the story of his life (and unlife) to interviewer Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater). Along the way we meet his maker Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise), his &quot;daughter&quot; Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), and Armand (Antonio Banderas), leader of the Parisian vampires.<br />Tom Cruise, in my mind, perfectly portrays the elder vampire Lestat...beautiful, cunning, selfish, a seducer, many of the same qualities present in Armand, and possesses an excess of dark humour. Brad Pitt's Louis still clings to the last shreds of his humanity...his sense of right and wrong, the value of life, the horror of killing in order to survive (angstmaster Nick Knight from &quot;Forever Knight&quot; springs to mind). There is a lack of onscreen romantic tension between Cruise and Pitt...something that makes their relationship seem less immediate and binding. However, there is definitely a spark between Louis and Armand (Antonio Banderas), and it was easy to believe that Louis was tempted to stay as a companion to such an intelligent, beautiful vampire who could teach him the answers to his questions. Kirsten Dunst is phenomenal as Claudia, the vampire with the mind and desires of a woman eternally trapped in the body of a doll-child.<br />The visuals are lavish, moody, stunningly brilliant, especially the world of 1800's New Orleans with its brocades, silks, and elaborate dresses. The atmosphere is appropriately dark, with plenty of fog and menacing nighttime damp. Elliot Goldenthal's score is string-driven, pulsing, tense, and underscores the action perfectly, the crowning piece being &quot;Libera Me&quot;.<br />Yes, this film is graphic at times, including two very graphic scenes involving mutilation, numerous &quot;feedings,&quot; homoeroticism, and brief nudity, but &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; is an unconventional drama that probes the meaning of life, death, love, seduction, and regret.

It hasn't left my DVD player, and I've probably watched it upwards of seven or eight times since. The cast is energetic and amazingly talented, the soundtrack is an excellent match to the various types of dance numbers, and the dancing itself is sublime.<br />I loved the extra features on this DVD, most notably the isolated soundtrack, director's commentary, deleted scenes and the extended dance sequences. The video by Mandy Moore was also a nice touch seeing as it uses footage of the cast of Center Stage and is an excellent song on its own.<br />The isolated soundtrack works well with the workshop numbers as well as the club scene. The commentary by Nicholas Hytner was interesting as well--for example, the NY skyline in the dance studio was simply a very large transparency. He also addresses technical aspects of shooting dancers and the infamous dance studio mirrors. There are only two deleted scenes: one of Cooper at a rehearsal for &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as he chats with Joan Miller, and one where Charlie performs a solo number in rehearsal, featuring stunning footwork and a playful mood.<br />The extended dance sequences flow much more smoothly without the constant cuts to the rather bored-looking audience, allowing the footwork and energy to shine through uninterrupted.<br />Although quips have been made regarding the acting abilities of the mostly dance-oriented cast, I thought that everyone involved did an outstanding job.

5.0,A DVD of Savage Beauty,"I first viewed Savage Garden: The Video Collection DVD last night. I've been a fan of Savage Garden since the beginning, but hadn't had a chance to  see any of their videos.  I was definitely impressed with this DVD. The  interactive menus are cleverly designed and easy to use, and the subtitles  (lyrics) are great for singing along (which I did) or for learning the  words of the individual songs. There are some added features such as  chapter access to songs and a profile of Savage Garden.  There are five  videos on this collection: To The Moon and Back, I Want You, Truly Madly  Deeply, Tears Of Pearls and Break Me Shake Me. The fun of this DVD is in  watching the differing hairstyles, clothes, atmospheres, and creative  visions of the individual videos. Although there are no interviews or  voiceovers, this collection provides a wonderful insight into Savage  Garden.  The music of Savage Garden represents many years of  behind-the-scenes effort by instrumentalist Daniel Jones and vocalist  Darren Hayes, and these videos perfectly capture the raw energy of the duo.

5.0,Beautiful Piece of Furniture!,"I love this piece of furniture! I ordered it thinking my teenage daughter would like a vanity in her bedroom. But when we discovered it could also be used as a desk by not attaching the mirror to it, she decided that she needed that more. She had a bulky glass desk that took up a lot of space in her bedroom. She had a chair that wouldn't slide under the desk, so it was always in the way, too. She used her old desk for storing things instead of as a desk.  She is thrilled with this!  It arrived safely. Everything was wrapped and padded so there were no scratches or nicks. It took my husband (and daughter) less than thirty minutes to put this together. My husband has had a lot of experience assembling furniture. Some brands are more difficult than others. He found these instructions to be simple and clear. The whole process was straight forward. All the screws and hardware was included.  The details on this piece are absolutely charming. There's a rope like edging to it. The drawer pulls are decorated metal pieces. The drawers pull out easily. The quality of this desk is very good. We've purchased inexpensive desks before and they haven't been half as nice as this one is. It doesn't feel cheap at all. My daughter had so much fun organizing the drawers and her desk top. The stool is a nice height for the desk and it slides under the desk so it doesn't get in the way. When she saw the mirror in person, she was conflicted because it's so pretty. She may change her mind later and ask her Dad to install it. But for now, she is so happy to have a functioning desk. She never sat at her old desk, but she's actually using this one!<br /><br />*I received this for free directly from the seller in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

5.0,THIS IS ONE MOVIE PARENTS & TEENS HAVE GOT TO SEE!,"This was one of my 15-year old daughter Elizabeth's favorite movies. (In fact, she often wore her To Save A Life promo shirt to school.) I read the book first, then saw the movie with Elizabeth (she had already seen the movie with our youth group the week before and it was the last movie we saw together as father and daughter; she died of unknown causes about a week later). To Save A Life is a powerful, gritty, true to life Christian film that deals with a lot of issues that plague our families and youth today: the cult of popularity, bullying, family troubles & divorce, depression, suicide, underage drinking, drugs, sex, teen pregnancy, and self abuse or cutting, etc. All this is seen through the eyes of Jake Taylor - high school senior, star athlete, popular man on campus, with a full-ride basketball scholarship to Louisville, and of course, the hottest girl in high school.<br /><br />After Jake's often ignored childhood friend Roger commits suicide in the hallway of their school, he begins to re-evaluate how he had treated his friend in recent years. As he starts to wrestle with his own sense of right and wrong and his responsibility to others, he meets Chris, a youth pastor who intrigues him despite his own lack of interest in religion. As Jake's relationships with his parents and girlfriend Amy deteriorate, Chris becomes someone he can talk to, and his weekly youth group becomes a safe place where he can hang out and just be himself without the fear of being judged. With Chris' help, Jake sets out on a journey of personal transformation and growth that will reveal God's amazing unconditional love and Jake's power to make a difference in the lives of others one person at a time beginning with Johnny, another outcast.<br /><br />This movie is so powerful I wish I could show it to every high school and junior high school in our area. The issues raised are often ignored in our society and fester under the surface in individual lives. Often we find out about them after the fact. They need to be addressed before then. Parents and youth need to know that the ONLY answer to life's problems is Jesus Christ, and that as follwers of our Lord we can have a positive ripple effect in the lives of others as we share the good news of the gospel. Whether you're a Christian or not, this is one movie that parents and their teenagers have got to see!<br /><br />Check out my book reviews of To Save A Life and Jake's Choice, the sequel, on Amazon.com!",[],B003EYVXZ0,B003EYVXZ0,AHOQCTRWIKMFF3GIW2WKBG4AJK5Q,1275109948000,79,True

Though I believed already in the God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, it wasn't till seeing this documentary I had an understanding of my innermost anger, frustration most of all loneliness! My questioning of my existence and what is my plan? Why have I been forsaken, what sins have I committed so badly to be given this life? The abuse and non sharing of deep pain growing up kept to myself to not cause family discord and keep us together as a family. What good has it done me. My siblings went on to have a life, positive or negative, right or wrong, happy times, not so happy times through their life. Freedom was given to each to make and seek. I well, let's say became the daughter (child) who was willing and lovingly became the caregiver, overseer of all aspects of running a household for my first twenty plus year's. Including being the peacemaker between our father ect  ...... My role hasn't changed and yes, I've become a bit more resentful. My love for my family is unconditional Now in my sixties I'm still carrying on the role, but without my dad in the last 1 1/2 years losing his struggle with Alzheimer's for 4 year's with me at home and most recently my close youngest brother to a severe painful cancer. Passing in 61 day's from diagnosis to going home. I gave my dad and brother my best unconditional loving caringness I could.<br />It's my brothers death that has really just brought ALL these raw repressed and current emotions to be constant in my daily life.<br />I cried or say balled and talked as I watched the program at times.

There's a clever linking of the cause and effect across several of the 10 plagues of Egypt.

5.0,90 Minutes Well-Spent,"It's getting to the point where you have to go back at least 10 years to find reasonably good movies.  This is a pretty good and lighthearted art robbery caper - a more humble and plebeian version of Oceans 1[123] to be sure, but still quite entertaining.  If you're a fan of Christopher Walken, Morgan Freeman, and/or William H. Macy, you'll enjoy this movie.  And Marcia Gay Harden as a bonus is delightful and plays her role to a tee as Roger's colorful wife Rose - a character that may be likened to a heterosexual version of Mrs. Goldman from The Birdcage.<br /><br />On the surface, this movie is about 3 men who have obsessions about 3 different pieces of art.  When they they discover these 3 art pieces are about to be moved overseas, they plan to steal them.  But you can also enjoy and appreciate this movie on another level - as a morality tale.  Their obsessions can be a equated with idolatry.  And that idolatry then leads to additional sins of coveting, lying, and stealing.<br /><br />Human art misleads them, the fruitless toil of painters, a figure stained with varied colors, whose appearance arouses yearning in fools so that they desire the lifeless form of a dead image (Wisdom of Solomon 15:4-5).<br /><br />But ultimately Roger recognizes his own wife Rose to be far more desirable and alluring than ""The Lonely Maiden"" painting.<br /><br />Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe, let her bosom satisfy you at all times, and always be transported with delight in her love (Proverbs 5:18-19).<br /><br />Whether viewed superficially or on a deeper level, this movie is enjoyable and funny - 1 hour and 30 minutes well spent.",[],B002Y0MQAQ,B002Y0MQAQ,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1619837900840,0,False

The discerning of today and future generations may look upon some aspects of today's science (e.g. evolution and cosmology) and find that it is seeded with deception and fraught with inaccuracies that are taught in schools and ingrained in children at an early age, and conclude that it too was a deliberate ""manufacturing of belief.""<br /><br />It is true that many organizations, institutions, and states have commandeered religions for their own social and political purposes.  But that doesn't mean the religion itself should be repudiated as a consequence.  And this is where the documentary makes an illogical leap - that religion should be rejected entirely because of the unethical psychological methods employed by the leadership of certain churches to mesmerize and brainwash its members into faith.<br /><br />But the individual may find merit in particular religion(s) after eliminating the structure, the ritual, the congregation, and the leaders, and instead consult directly the holy scriptures upon which major religions are based: (e.g. The Torah, The Bible Old Testament OR New Testament, The Qur'an, etc.).  Read them yourself.  You may find unexpected meaning, significance, and familiarity with what is contained therein which resonates with your own personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs.  Or not.<br /><br />Interestingly, the Qur'an preemptively addresses the atheist perspective in the following verse:  ""They say, ‘There is nothing but the life of this world: we live and we die and nothing destroys us but time.’ But they do not have any knowledge of that and they only make conjectures."" - Qur'an 45:24",[],B08B1VFHNB,B08B1VFHNB,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1600145729468,2,True

Whenever you see children being used in this way, that's a sign that there's something nefarious behind the production.

I think they're still poking at the problem with a sharp stick and haven't fundamentally identified what underlies it all.

It takes more than visual bedazzlement to make a movie great.  But what warrants my 1 star review is a very cheap and disturbing plot device used all too often in movies to villainize the villain and to heroize the hero.  And that is to put a child in danger.  This movie takes it way too far, showing a 5 year-old child kidnapped, crying, and later killed by a gunshot (in slow motion no less).

For example, you pose the irrelevant question of wouldn't it make sense to put a robot on the moon before a man on the moon to reduce risk?  No, it wouldn't, because no robot could replace the critical thinking nor the piloting skills and dexterity required to operate the spacecraft to perform the mission to put a man on the moon by 1969.  You show side-by-side video frames of the two space shuttle disasters, labeled Challenger on the left, Columbia on the right.  But the footage for both is Challenger.

5.0,Very good modern adaptation of Bradbury's classic novel,"This is a very good modern adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  Its message is perhaps more relevant, more important today than in 1953 when the book was first published.  This version effectively adapts the story of Bradbury's prophetic dystopian future  into a modern day context.<br /><br />The essential story is the same which is of the Firemen whose job it is (and apparently always was) to burn outlawed books and to find and summarily sentence those who possess them.  This, to protect society from exposure to differing thoughts, opinions, beliefs, and ideas which would only result in confusion and mental illness.  The society of Fahrenheit 451 demands these book burnings seen as necessary,  and they revel in the nightly book burning broadcasts.  They also enjoy socializing in isolation in &#34;vivid&#34; virtual reality cafe's, wearing 3D headsets and gesticulating into empty space in synchronicity with the simulation they find themselves in.  Daily calibrated doses of drug-infused eyedrops help each individual to maintain a simple-minded sense of comfort and happiness.<br /><br />Some negative reviews complain that this movie misses the mark, one complaining that it is not only a criticism of mass media but also against tech trends.  Well, I believe that is one of the main themes of this adaptation of Bradbury's story.  It is the combination and coordination of mass media and technical trends designed for public consumption which provide the platform to enable this degree of information and social management.  Smart phones, smart devices, Wi-Fi and cellular network devices, web content monitoring, collection and fusion of public and private information, are but a few of these technologies.  They provide the data to enable surveillance, tracking, and prediction of the behavior not just of an individual but also in aggregate of an entire society.<br /><br />Subtle social engineering can be achieved by defining the issues which should be of concern to everyone, staging or manufacturing the events that highlight the issues, creating the headlines, writing the stories, and thereby steering the opinion of an entire society into a single common stream of group-think.  But such a platform could be used not only in a capacity to unite but also to divide a society into opposing factions of subgroup-think.  This could have been the ignition source for the Second Civil War mentioned briefly in this story.",[],B07D5TTNQC,B07D5TTNQC,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1527904773498,13,True

They discuss the deception, disinformation, and manipulation of society by government and corporate interests.  However where this fails is its conclusion of who's behind it and what the solution is.  Mr. Bowers claims that a return to Christian values and the traditional Republican Party of the Reagan Era will fix things.  Well it won't.  Scapegoat labels like Liberal, Progressive, Far-left, Communist offer convenient bad guys for those responsible.

1.0,Stylish narrative but not much substance,"Half of this video is essentially Israeli State propaganda which I have no problem with, but the other half regarding Torah codes is less detailed than I expected.  Rather than showing how the Torah codes are developed and how they map to the selection of letters that yield some prediction, that detail is glossed over.  Instead we're just shown letters circled on a page that create words and phrases that formed a prediction.  Not very convincing that there's something divine at work here.  The video also goes off on some tangents that aren't very relevant or convincing.  For example there's a discussion that the Bible refers to UFOs in Deuteronomy 1:28 by the phrase &#34;large fortress cities in the sky&#34; as interpreted from the Torah in original Hebrew.  Most other biblical translations of this phrase are &#34;great cities fortified to the heavens&#34;.

Even though Prometheus was shot with a 3D camera, the depth of field just isn't very apparent in most live-action shots.  The occasional object thrown into the foreground seems forced and is often more distracting than integral into the overall scene.  Disappointingly devoid of significant 3D effect are the opening scenes of the planet's landscape and the landing approach of Prometheus.  The 3D effects are most evident in scenes with CGI such as the mapping of the tunnels as shown on the bridge of the Prometheus and text overlays.  Still, for $5 more than the basic blu-ray version of this movie, I would say this 4-disk version is preferred:  both for the 3D disk and for the special features disk.",[],B0085Z8F4A,B0085Z8F4A,AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,1349985232000,1,True

5.0,A Great Coming of Age Story,"This wonderful film is currently running on Showtime, and I hope it finds a wider audience.  I had never heard of this film, but I was drawn in by the description and I am so glad I found it.<br /><br />&#34;Like Sunday, Like Rain&#34; is a coming of age story in the best sense of the word.  Reggie (Julian Shatkin), a twelve-year-old cello prodigy, is a massively gifted but lonely and isolated child whose parents are incredibly wealthy, cold, and distant.  His father (or step-father) is away in China and his mother is about to join her husband for the summer.  She hires Eleanor (Leighton Meester), a young woman from the opposite end of the economic and social scale, to be his nanny for six weeks.<br /><br />Left to themselves, and after a slightly rocky start, the two begin a wonderful relationship that enriches both.  The film traces this relationship through the summer, introducing us to Eleanor's dysfunctional family and showing the growth of both main characters.  The &#34;coming of age&#34; part is, of course, primarily Reggie's, but Eleanor experiences her own maturation and resolves several issues from her own childhood.  Both actors are superb, taking material that could have been trite or sentimental and making it real and compelling.<br /><br />The film's ending is not a fairy tale, but it is satisfying.  The title refers to a musical composition written by Reggie, and it forms the musical theme of the film.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  No violence, no sex, just the humanity of two people who come to love and respect one another.",[],B00S0DW62O,B00S0DW62O,AGWGMDSRIXUSGG3AVYX65RVPWCLQ,1454171093000,9,False

People excused JFK's malaprop rather than mock him, because they knew what was in his heart.<br /><br />One needs to look deeper into people, before making quick judgments.<br /><br />This film captures that, using charming Chaya's (Laura Fraser) coming of age journey, as a young Jewish woman living a life with little real meaning or direction, until she happens upon a deeper understanding of who she is, through finding deeper meanings in others. The film shows how people may try to run from who they really are, but sooner or later they must confront it, if they are to mature.<br /><br />The transformation of Chaya begins when accepting a job as a nanny to a Chassidic family.<br /><br />Happiness, tragedy, and imperfect people all serve to find that deeper understanding for Chaya. It are dramatic words from the wonderful Isabella Rossellini, as the Chassidic mom, to Chaya, as a ""daughter of Israel,"" which signals the completion of the transformation.<br /><br />Yes, the film's title, and Chaya's dad's (Maximillian Shell)  search for what was left in the past, has symbolic meaning.

What to do?<br /><br />Well, if the movie grabs you in any way, watch it again, and if it grabs you some more, watch it once more.<br /><br />For me, it was the opening 20 minutes or so, which grabbed me. Such a bizarre couple, but with a special chemistry that made me want to learn as much about them as I could. Plus, the photography, bits of music, etc., were also inviting in those minutes.  So, I was willing to see the film through, even though at times it tried to lose me.<br /><br />After seeing it the first time, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars or so. However, I still had a desire to see it again, now that I could revisit scenes with a better understanding and from different viewpoints.<br /><br />So, the second viewing really did hook me, now that the plot was clearer. Two people, so different and so flawed, yet finding that special bond, with the unconscious figuring out things that somehow eluded the conscious. I personally can relate to that, remembering I had a dream once, where, in the dream I actually recognized that I was in a dream, so that my unconscious was indeed plugged directly into my conscious.<br /><br />I have always questioned how in a two minute conversation, talk show pseudo-therapists can tell a caller to drop a deeply flawed mate. Aren't even the deeply flawed, allowed to experience love? Of course they are, and this film really does capture that.<br /><br />Someone commented in their review that there were no words worthy to remember from the film, however, I will never see the word, ""nice,"" in quite the same way again.<br /><br />Without the performances from Carrey and Winslet and the chemistry they generated, this film likely would not have succeeded in capturing the power of love in quite the way it did. I give it five stars.",[],B0002G2B2M,B0002G2B2M,AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,1108848561000,6,False
5.0,An appreciation which is still growing!,"My comments really apply to both films, ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" as I saw them one after the other, a day apart. Each could stand alone, but together, they just fit.<br /><br />I thought a lot about whether to give the films four or five stars. There are a lot of films which have more aspects to them.  But, are those films better? Maybe, but I just enjoyed these in different ways.<br /><br />So, that's why I give ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" five stars each. They just grab you. What some might criticize the films for, just make them better, in my opinion. For instance, some criticize the films as slow moving, but as I see it, I like to spend more time with people I like and want to root for.<br /><br />Plus, I see a parallel between a couple building such a bond in a short time, but are questioning whether it will last, and my reaction to the films right after seeing them. My appreciation of the films just seems to grow.<br /><br />Thanks, Ethan and Julie. It's hard to imagine the roles without you.",[],B0002YLC24,B0002YLC24,AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,1105550319000,0,False
5.0,Wonderful Movie!,"&quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; is a wonderful movie, which can be enjoyed many times. Ben Stiller, Edward Norton, and Jenna Elfman are perfect together in this romantic comedy, directed by Norton.<br />Friendship, love, spontaneity, spirituality and fun mix with religion, tradition, duty, and ritual. How Stiller, a rabbi, Norton, an Irish Catholic priest, and Elfman, an Irish Catholic gal struggle to balance these is a joy. The supporting cast is terrific also, especially Anne Bancroft as Stiller's mom.<br />It is brilliant how such serious issues can be dealt with in such a light hearted and comical way. The fine soundtrack also compliments the movie. One standout tune is &quot;Heart of Mine,&quot; sung by Peter Salett at the end of the film.<br />Being set in Manhattan, the film has additional appeal to anyone who has ever lived there.",[],B000055ZJI,B000055ZJI,AFJBKPK5W56XWSNPQU2WW66ISWYQ,1002867261000,4,False

3.0,Disappointed,"I wanted to love this movie, I really did. It was even the first time I purchased a brand new movie on streaming, because I wanted to see it that much. I am a huge fan of anything related to Princess Diana and/or the British royal family, of any era.  Let me start with the positive. I think Kristen Stewart did a wonderful job mastering the accent and mannerisms of the late Princess. She looked stunning and very much honored Diana.  I think she is a fine actor. That being said, I think actors can only do but so much with the material and direction given.  I found the movie surprisingly uncomfortable to watch. After paying to rent the film, I only watched about 1/3 of it before stopping to take a break after Diana ran… in heels… across a lumpy field to dismantle a scarecrow that allegedly was wearing her father’s old jacket? I then watched a bit more, up and to the point Diana and her young sons are sitting alone together in a room playing a silly word game that went on and on. I literally lost interest at this point and never finished the film I had paid to rent.  If you’re hoping for something of the riveting quality seen in “The Crown” series, this is not it.",[],B09KNGP1BG,B09KNGP1BG,AENR7RAJSAIV6E2UE6AZ7BUEIOIQ,1644348484276,6,True

The script and screen-play alternately makes you laugh when you least expect it, then totally shocked by the next move, then intrigued by the next revelation. The whole story is taken in a totally new direction that is both fantastic and believable. My only ONLY complaint is that the ending leaves something to be desired. I won't spoil it, but by this point you've already figured out the point made in the end scene. It could've been left out completely without harming the whole at all.<br />I love a good suspense but I'd long ago given up on any good scare movies.

I'm sure my heart rate went up, and I could<br />feel a burn in my thighs at one point.<br /> She shows how to stay flexable, how to keep your balance,<br />how to stand up streight, keep the tummy flat,tighten your abs, legs stronger.<br /><br />You only need a chair, two light weights,or what is comfortable for you, or a couple of cans of food, and maybe a towel.<br /><br />Jane is amazing to have such good posture, and a FLAT tummy at her age.<br />She does look Fabulous.<br /><br /> I have Osteoporosis now, and I think one of Jane's exercises is<br />not a good idea for anyone with Osteoporosis!<br />It was the exercise with weights in your hands to move from side to side sort of.<br />When you have Osteoporosis you should not twist at the waist.<br />After doing 1 & 2 back to back, the lower right side of my back still hurts me the next day<br />from doing that one exercise.<br />Next time, I won't do that exercise,I'll do something else that Jane shows. You can pick and choose what is suitable for you. If you can't stand, then sit etc.<br /><br />If your a hard core exerciser this is NOT the DVD for you at all.<br />My Daughter is at the gym everyday, and she would chuckle that her mother is doing these exercisers. Wait till she is my age. hah..<br /><br />This is a good DVD for people basicly over 60, or if you have not exercises in a long time due to illness, are not too moble, are over weight. If your in a wheel chair you can do some of the exercises etc.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a little more moving around.<br />At first watching this, I was confused by the Clear chair Jane is sitting in. It seemed hard<br />to know if she was sitting down, and on what, and was happening etc!<br /><br />I would buy this Dvd again, but like I said, I would have liked a little more moving around, or<br />maybe some type of dancing, but done slow, so it can be followed.<br /><br />Just a reminder: Jane Fonda has had two hip replacments and a knee replacment, which could be the reason she is not too steady on her feet, when she is standing on one foot at a time.<br />She is still amazing to be able to do what she does, and her body is still great for her<br />age:-)<br /><br />Up Date..12-14-11..<br /><br />After doing this DVD for a while, It is now SOOOO Boring, not fun.<br />Would I buy this again, NO.<br />It is really for beginers, and for someone who does not exercise much, or move around much, or who is over weight, As I said from my other review above..<br /><br />I understand Jane's other two new DVD's are faster and more fun..<br />Hopfully not as boreing as this one has become.

5.0,Fun!,"I recently purchased Volume 4 of Classic Cartoons, which includes over three hours of ad-free cartoons for just  $.99 (Whaaa?) to watch whenever I like! Some volumes are available to watch free with ads, but I’m spoiled and rarely watch anything with ads. Anyway, these are the old cartoons—true classics. especially love watching them on Saturday mornings with a bowl of cereal (or straight out of the box) the way my brother and I did while my parents slept in. Good times.<br /><br />They don’t make cartoons like this anymore. Some are some from the 30s, 40s & 50s and are absolutely fascinating. They’re like little animated movies/musicals created with such amazing precision, that it’s hard to believe they’re not digital. Each cartoon was made by hundreds of animators. They started off with hand-drawn pictures that were redrawn over and over, but slightly altered each time to create movement of the characters and landscape. Later all the pictures were sequenced, colorized, photographed and then voiced-over to make a 5-15 minute cartoon. Very early cartoons, before cells and machines were used, were completely hand-made and could take over a week to create 12 seconds of  a 10-minute minute cartoon. Researching this has been fun.<br /><br />I’m so happy with this purchase and if you love vintage cartoons, I highly recommend spending the minuscule $.99 to BUY the volumes that are available to purchase before the prices go up—and you know they’ll go up. (Ps: renting is the same price, so you might as well buy!) It’s one of the best things I’ve ever purchased on Amazon (and I’ve purchased a lot!).",[],B074ZS3JGY,B074ZS3JGY,AFNQQL6PA67ODXLQTKF4L3YM2TAA,1628303607622,0,True
5.0,A Beautiful Sadness,"Oh, my. What an incredible and mesmerizing film. I understand how  Anthony Hopkins won the Academy Award for ‘Best Actor.’ He’s leaves his essence and becomes the people he plays.<br /><br />Hopkins believably takes us into the mind of someone suffering with Alzheimer’s. At least that was my understanding after witnessing my mother and sister-in-law slip into this disease. In ‘The Father,’ it’s as if we can almost see who and what they see—and suffer with them as we feel the confusion, love, anger, child-like innocence, sadness, and needless shame they must feel. Olivia Coleman is also outstanding. The emotions she shares with her face and eyes is heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Cheers to Hopkins, Coleman and the filmmakers for bringing more education and understanding about Alzheimer’s and dementia to the screen. May it lead to more movies like this, but more importantly, may it lead to more love and compassion for those who live with the disease—and those who care for them.",[],B08Z8CXGXC,B08Z8CXGXC,AFNQQL6PA67ODXLQTKF4L3YM2TAA,1626146429819,2,True

If you’re a Creek fan, you understand my crush. Been watching it since it came out in 2017 and it’s a rare week when I don’t watch at least one episode (or season).

5.0,Touching Story of an Undocumented Girl,I have to say that I wish the DVD contained the full 60 minute version. This truncated version is apparently made to fit into a 50 minute secondary school class period. It would be better to let people the whole show in 2 class periods. Still this is the first time I’m seeing it. I am an ENL teacher so the subject matter is important and it’s a great YA drama. A young teen and her undocumented mother move in with a suburban family with a teenage girl her same age. The daughter of the suburban family is pretty and white and wants to fit in with those kids. A Latin American girl whose mother is a maid isn’t an acceptable friend. But circumstances occur that prompts the girls to become better friends. A big motivation for me to watch the DVD was being a huge fan of Linda Lavin and Bruce Solomon. They both do very well as the parents. I was pleased. Too bad that Nickelodeon and Disney aren’t required to make a few responsible programs for kids and teens. These were great. Wonderworks  is a PBS initiative goes quality programming in the 80s.

4.0,Thoughtful Movie about a Bloody Coup,"A young woman meets with a woman who survived the Thammasat University Massacre in 1976. This leads her her to deal with death, her country as it is now and the attempt to make a small indie film. There is little about the massacre itself but it is mentioned. The young woman is living in a under a military dictatorship as we speak in Thailand and she has to compare herself to the heroic woman who stood up to the government years ago and lost. The Thai military allows most to live a good life as long as they don’t speak out or protest their rule, and why this movie is so passive in its approach. So what is the right path?  Living under military rule and taking advantage of the path to least existence or challenging that rule and risk massacre and violence?  There is no answer, but a reminder of those who once challenged that rule and died.",[],B079R2Q3HM,B079R2Q3HM,AG7JSIKUQPSL5AAPRDRKDNWM4U2A,1572760880614,1,True

5.0,Documentary About People Who Harvest America's Wheat Crop With Giant Combines,"Having grown up in the Midwest, I love watching giant combines travel in staggered rows across vast fields of golden wheat, as they harvest the ripened crop.  This excellent documentary, THE GREAT AMERICAN WHEAT HARVEST, includes some beautiful footage of  combines in action, but it's primarily about the people who take those huge combines on the road each summer to bring in the latest crop.<br /><br />These ""custom harvesters"" can consist of large operations that buy new combines and hire and train many employees each season, or of small businesses that buy used combines and employ family members as food preparers, truck drivers, and harvesters.  Regardless of the outfit's size, once the harvest begins the race is on to get all the wheat cut before rain, hail, wind, or fire can destroy it.  The harvest starts in fields in Texas, moves north through fields in Kansas and Nebraska, and ends in fields in Montana--and those heavy combines, with accompanying supply trailers and living quarters, must be transported along state roads from field to field.<br /><br />It's heartbreaking to see the effects of the ongoing Midwestern drought.  Some fields are mere stubble, with barely enough standing wheat stalks to cut.  But other fields are a sight to see, with standing wheat stalks bearing plump, fully-formed grains.  The documentary shows that farmers and custom harvesters alike are interesting, upbeat people who love what they do.  And that they always shrug off adversity by looking forward to next year's harvest.<br /><br />Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me by the seller free of charge for review purposes.

But sadly with few discrepancies within the last 10 or so minutes made me believe that the writer or quite possibly the director wasn’t wanting to be authentic about the Mass and Communion in that era.

5.0,"Amazing deal, $16 was a steal for this","I purchased the 3 Disc DVD (just normal DVD, not Blu ray) set, Extended Collector's Edition, and I was pleasantly surprised by the product I received. I wasn't expecting the packaging and movie boxes to be such high quality and so nice! I would have been content with just a normal movie cover, but this movie can with three slips over it. The first slip is just a normal cardboard slip that goes over the second covering which is a boxed cover, and much thicker than the first and the third case slips out of the second one, which has the three movie disks in it. Overall, it's very durable and just overall beautiful. Easily my favorite packaged movie. The picture quality and sound is amazing and there are so many awesome features to choose from and it's such a high quality movie! The movie was split onto Disc 1 and Disc 2 so you'll need to get up halfway through to change the disc but it's worth the little extra work!

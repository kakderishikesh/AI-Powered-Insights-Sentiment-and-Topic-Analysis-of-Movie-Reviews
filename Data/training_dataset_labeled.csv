5.0,"I have always admired Jane Goodall and borrowed this from my library as soon as it became available. This is a story about her early life when researching chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Africa. Most of the footage shown in this documentary is from the 1960's and filmed by her husband at that time (Hugo van Lawick). I found her narration and video riveting. Jane is a sensible woman who lived out her dream but also had to suffer and witness hardships due to that dream. Her immersion into the chimpanzee community has given the world more insight into these primates than any other researcher.<br /><br />I LOVED this documentary so much that I did not want it to end. Jane is the type of person who I wish I had the opportunity to converse with for hours. She has a wonderful philosophy on life and both human and animal nature.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the film is the loud music played throughout the movie. The tunes were so loud that they almost drowned out Jane's soft-spoken voice. It would have been much better if nature's sounds or music the volume of a &#34;whisper&#34; were played instead.  Other than this, this film was sensational in my eyes.",1532659083014,positive
2.0,"I found this to be a lousy movie with chaotic scenes, lots of nonsensical cursing, and very little dancing. Only one scene at the beginning had about 30 seconds of dance (which was incredible and the best of the entire movie) and then about 10 minutes at the end (most of which was filled up with special affects and props that made the dances less visible). In addition, most of the movement was raunchy--not necessarily a bad thing but it lacked artistic style in my opinion. This movie was very disappointing; I'm so glad I borrowed it from the library.",1448718427000,neutral
4.0,"I immediately liked this documentary from the start but by the time I was done viewing it I was in love.<br /><br />""Tell it on the Mountain"" is a documentary that captures the motivation, unwavering determination, and personal setbacks of several hikers who embark on a five-month wilderness journey along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).<br /><br />The PCT is a 2,663 mile footpath extending from the Mexican to Canadian Border. The two other major US trails are the Appalachian Trail (AT) and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT). Part of the PCT traverses the Sierras which are both beautiful and treacherous. The scenery captured in these parts is both captivating and sometimes scary.<br /><br />The hikers profiled are from various backgrounds and countries.  Some travel solo and others travel as a pair including a couple who hiked to their wedding. Most of the trekkers thru (one way) hike but one hiker does a yo-yo (round-trip) hike.  The hikers in many cases document their own journey, travelling with the camera affixed to them as they walk.  Although some of the filming is shaky as a result, at times it made the experience more real and I often felt as if I were tagging along in the scene.<br /><br />These hikers are motivated to hike the PCT for many reasons.  For some it may be to reach a lofty goal and for others it may be to get the weight of the world off their shoulders.  One reason Inaki, the Spanish fellow, hikes is because ""It's much better to go for something and realize that you were wrong, than not knowing at all if you were wrong or right.""  I could not agree more;  after all, what is life if all you have are regrets?<br /><br />The film left me so energized that I had trouble sleeping last night. It roused my adventurous nature and I began reliving my 2005 journey to Antarctica and that trip's Shackleton walk.  It also brought back memories of my time in camp as a teenager in the early 70's when, on several occasions, I overnight hiked the Sussex County portion of the AT with just a sleeping bag for protection. It was during my AT hikes that I developed a dream to hike the entire AT. Although I never did that thru hike and probably never will, this film certainly rekindled that desire.<br /><br />In summary, ""Tell it on the Mountain"" gives a glimpse of what motivates a handful of adventurous hikers to go on this long journey surrounded by nature and relying mostly on their own fortitude to live the simplest of existence for part of one year.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT:  I received a review copy of this documentary from the producer and I found the pre-release version of the film to be very close to five stars.  For those who are interested in a more in-depth understanding of one person's motivation to hike the PCT, I recommend reading [[ASIN:0307592731 Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail (Oprah's Book Club 2.0)]].<br /><br />UPDATE March 23, 2013 - I watched this film again but this time with my boyfriend. He gives it five stars and feels it's a quality production.  He actually stayed up late to watch it and did not fall asleep like he usually does when watching videos so I know he enjoyed it as did I a second time around.",1363919077000,neutral
5.0,"For me this was an utterly heartbreaking movie.<br /><br />This documentary is a about both sides of the exotic animal trade; those that keep exotic animals for pets and those that disagree with that and want to outlaw this practice.  In our society we are often led to believe that owning an exotic animal is cool, cute, or something easy to do.  However, this is rarely the case and this documentary exposes both sides of the story.<br /><br />Tim Harrison is the safety officer called in to rescue many of these animals when they are discarded. Terry Brumfield is one of the several exotic animal owners who loves his lions like children.  There is no easy answer on this issue.  As a pet owner I understand the tremendous bond a human has with their animal and the bond with an exotic animal would be no different.  They are like your children.  However, I also believe wild animals should remain in the wild and people should not try to domesticate them.  I have no doubt there are wonderful exotic animal owners out there, but I think many exotic animal owners are unaware of what they are getting themselves into. In many cases it is unfair to the animal to be kept in captivity to live a life we think is appropriate for them.<br /><br />This documentary highlighted both sides of the debate and from both sides it was heartbreaking to watch and also provoked anger at the inadequate confinement and care of some of the exotic animals depicted.",1343525368000,positive
4.0,"This is a very interesting movie about lyme disease, the neurological effects of this disease, and how this disease can affect those who contract it.  There is a slight political edge to the movie in the sense that it highlights how many doctors and patients feel they are being ignored and told that what they have can't possibly be lyme disease and that it's all in their head.  Those who heavily believe in lyme disease link it to Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc.<br /><br />Although the movie is more about those who support lyme disease and the theory that its effects are prevalent, I still feel ""Under Our Skin"" highlights the opposing side as well. Some doctors and all insurance agencies (it seems) consider this a very treatable disease but this movie made me think, are they wrong?",1343512821000,neutral
5.0,"This is a documentary about Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski who in 1977 discovered a non-toxic cure for cancer. He found that cancer patients usually lack compounds called antineoplastons. In order to cure cancer, he synthesizes these compounds and uses them to treat some cancer patients successfully at his institute in Texas. He has treated many hopeless cases, usually children, where the cancer they had was known to be fatal with our typical cancer treatment. Instead these children and some adults are walking around today totally cancer free. Although he is not successful in all cases, Dr. Burzynski has a noticeably higher cure rate than the toxic regimen our current medical system uses to treat cancer (chemo and radiation).<br /><br />What is very enlightening about this movie is that the federal government (specifically the FDA) has been trying to put him behind bars for treating cancer. However, the real reason they are doing this is because there are billions of dollars to be lost if our society does not continue the toxic cancer regiment that currently exists.  After all many companies have huge investments in equipment and drugs and that revenue would be lost if a cure for cancer was found.  Also, these big companies do not want one guy to receive all the profits  as Dr. Burzynski holds all the patents for his treatment.<br /><br />In this documentary, you'll also learn that one of his former colleagues who now works for the government was able to get the federal government to issue duplicate patents to her in an effort to steal his work.  Luckily, Dr. Burzynski successfully thwarted that effort.<br /><br />The federal government did everything they could to discredit this doctor and throw him in jail and failed.  They even tried to pretend to work with him by offering to trial his regimen.  In fact, this was the absolutely most chilling point about this documentary.  Once again, the federal government (specifically the National Cancer Institute) purposely altered Dr. Burzynski's cancer treatment in a trial they were doing by reducing the antineoplastons regimen that he prescribed.  The National Cancer Institute knew that all the patients would die in this study with that regiment but they did it anyway so that they could discredit him and steal his treatment. To me this is pre-meditated murder.<br /><br />The story told here is appalling.  Every day that antineoplastons don't become an available option in our society to treat cancer is another day one or more patients dies from the disease.<br /><br />A non-toxic cure for cancer exists that is more effective than our current toxic chemotherapy and radiation treatments and offers better chances for survival in many cases. I commend Dr. Burzynski for having such character to continue to fight for his right to make his cancer treatment more successful and appears to care so much about curing the cancer patient.",1343267933000,negative

5.0,"I am using these aero base DVDs for general health improvements and we work out on the Lemond rev,aster pro:  each of the DVDs is based in a different location with a different group of cyclists, and each workout is different from each other.  The main theme is that they work on our aerobic level and not the muscle burning anaerobic  session.  What does that mean for those new to spinning and exercising on a spin bike: you are taken to a level where you are out of breathe, but not to the point that your leg muscles are burning; there is plenty of 'position2' to help stretch on some of the DVDs..  You will sweat so bring plenty of liquid.  You can do this with music or no music. If you don't have 75 minutes, I normally fast forward to the time I have to work out, but note there is 10 minutes warmup and 7 minutes warm down. Can't praise these workouts enough. The music may to be as great as in a spin class, but the workout is much much better.<br /><br />There are instructions for the tension requirement for spinning, but it is really the combo of cadence and heart rate that will reap the full benefit of the workout.  But hell, you get a great workout regardless.  I have my favorite DVDs, but love the fact there is a choice and I won't get bored.

This was an intense 45 minutes of interval workout that consists of four sets of workouts :<br />Set one: five sets of one minute rpm of 100-120 (intensity of 2) with 30 seconds rest<br />Set two: five sets of one minutes rpm of 70-85 at intensity of 4-5 (5 maximum) with 30 seconds rest<br />Set three: five sets of increasing intensity at one minute and keeping rpm at around 85 with 30 seconds rest<br />Set four: three sets of one minutes with increasing resistance and 30 seconds rest.<br /> Prepared to work out!  I loved it better than any spin class and spin class-like DVD workout.<br /><br />The dash board as usual had the heart rate intensity, rpm range,  spin intensity range.

This workout had great variations from hill, interval and speed, all set against beautiful scenery.  There is dashboard that gives you enough information that you can either work with perceived effort (1 to 10, same as in spin class) to all the metrics if you had a monitor for rpm, heart %.  I loved the music as it is all rock themed and dateless.  I couldn't believe when the 1 hour was up!  I like this training DVD a whole lot better than the 'spinning' brand.  Spinervals are great too, as it is trying for cyclists.  Great DVD if you just have 1 hour to workout.  Love all the trivia facts and motivational quotes!",1324839616000,positive

4.0,"This is DVD with a play time of 80 minutes and they have created two shorter playtimes out of it: one at 46 minutes and the other 60 minutes.  What this meant is that both the shorter rides have 'jumps' in them to jump to the next move.  It is not that distracting, but noticeable. I am okay with it as I don't have 80 minutes during work week to do the full ride, so the shorter rides mean I can still cycle!  One less star due to the editing for the shorter rides!<br /><br />The moves and changes are very similar to those of current day spin classes, yes the music is not the latest, but like all work out DVDs, there is just enough of the beat to keep you in beat to the rpm that you need to go to: there are speeds, interval s and hills.  The rest is up to you to work harder if you are feeling good, or less if your body is not that cooperative!  The instructions are great even for beginners as she does explain postures and safe riding positions.  Loved it.  Better than the 'spinning' brand so far, hope she comes out with a few more; but for now there is enough variation that I will not get bored anytime soon!",1324515199000,positive

5.0,"I love spinning and finally decided to get my own bike to remove myself from net stress of booking a class!  How does this stack against a class- it is different and the reason as raised by an earlier reviewer : this DVD is for training your mind to work with your body at a certain pace for an extended period of time, then Change up or down for another extended period of time (unlike a spin class where you are never doing the same tempo/resistance for more than 2 minutes so your mind is never still).  Just like trying to sit still or meditate, you need to train your mind and your body!  This is s great DVD for starting this traing. I did find my mind wondering, I was getting mentally restless, but I persevere as the instructor was pretty good in talking through the program.  The rest is up to you and how much your body wants to push it wrt resistance and speed.  The instructor reference to heart rate % and rpm using a monitor, or he also references to scale of 1 to 10 as a sense of difficulty so don't rush out and buy anything extra!  Most of it is done in position 1 (sitting), but there are options and up to you If you want to do some of it at position 2 (standing up).  The instructor also offered you a range of rpm to work in: do more or less depending on your metal and physical fitness level.<br /><br />This is not interval training or hill training.  I certainly got a good workout from it.  the music is not what you would expect, but to tell you the truth, you are so focused on what you are doing and listening to the next change that I really didn't notice the music that much.  I think I will be using this DVD at different level of intensity as my fitness improves, certainly will not get bored of it anytime soon.",1323737286000,positive
5.0,"Thank goodness for the modifications.  My fitness has fallen dramatically after a couple of years of dealing with life's crisis, I had unconsciously packed on more calories and now I am doing it something about it.  I have started with Jillian Michael and I wanted more variety with calories burn without all the jumping around as I live in an apt. So this DVD was absolutely perfect: challenging moves that gets you sweating within 5minutes.  Yeah you will feel your muscles burn, but since I am slightly unfit, I felt okay to catch my breathe in some of the moves.. As long as I keep moving, keep going.  my goal is to be able to keep up and in the meantime, i do my best,  it was great that there were modifications and that two of three people demonstrating were not that fit, so it was reassuring to go down this journey together.  I did not feel inadequate!  I actually ended up doing 45 minutes of the exercises on first try and that surprised me given the macho comments on the various reviews!  So ladies if you have been working up to L2 with jillian Michaels' various shred it DVDs, then you certainly give this DVD a good stab.  I am glad I got this one and it will be mixed in with my other strength training DVDs.",1308267480000,positive
5.0,"You can only begin to transform if you learn to let go of your negative emotions. many women store their negative emotion in their shoulders and solar plexus: this kundalini dvd really works in these areas through meditative moves and breath work.  Dont be deceived by some of the meditative moves as I was working up a sweat to keep going and to hold the position!  I felt great after an hour of a matrix combination, as I usually do; great mentally, physically and physically.  For those new to kundalini and to Ravi and Ana, please watch the breath primer as this is such an important integral part of kundalini yoga and finish any matrix work out with the relaxation, chant and closing prayer: all my favorite parts to complete my yoga moment.  As always, the instructions always provides alternative positions for those who are a stiffer than Ana, like me.<br /><br />I loved this dvd to work on my stiff upper back and shoulders (lots of stored negative energy) and I certainly felt lighter afterwards once the emotions were released.  Haha, you may find that you are replaying those negative scenes as you work through the program: this is not untypical!  I had to force my mind back onto the yoga and try to keep my mind still.  Lovely to see my own transformation as I am working through the program. When I am working on the section: transform yourpast, the release of the tension in my shoulders is through a huuuuuuge yawn/mouth stretch!  No kidding, the release was palatable and boy did it feel good.<br /><br />This new dvd has many of my favorites parts and three  new routines and moves with the usual great explanation of what each move provides.  Thank you for printing the lyrics for the chant!!  I LOVE the great experiences and benefits that I get from Ravi and Ana's teachings: so blessed to have another great teaching dvd to choose from my growing Ravi and Ana collections in my daily spiritual journey.<br /><br />Great for beginners and especially if you know you have emotional issues to deal with.  I also recommend the yoga cleanse as this helps to clean out toxins in your organs that are also created from stress.",1266288533000,positive
5.0,"If you are a big fan of the material produced by Ravi and Ana, then one of the uniqueness of their kundalini dvds is that they combine movement with a section on meditation/mantra. here in this dvd is a collection of meditations that you could either a) choose your own combination to work on that day or b) use click onto one of the six pre-determined meditation program that ranges from beginner (if you are new to Ravi and Ana, then this is a must to as they will help you to make the most of the meditation session when you are selecting your own program).  For those of you who are already familiar with Ravi and Ana's format then you will absolutely love this one.<br />What I love about this new dvd is that I can now focus just on breathe work, which is such a fundamental foundation to yoga and often not touched on in other yoga dvds.  The pre-determined meditation programs are excellent if you have about 40 to 50 minutes; I loved the AM and PM ones, which were brilliant to get my day going and for the ultimate calm down at the end of the day. I have been hyper stressed with taking care of my elderly parents, as well as holding down a job that some days all I want to do is to re focus my energy.  This dvd works well with the ultra stretch kundalini yoga dvd: great combination to work the stress out of your mind and out of your body.<br /><br />Believe me, breathe work is just as challenging to the body and mind as the Navel power dvd!  Well worth the money and I am hyper pleased to add this dvd to my Ravi and Ana collection and weekly workout.

Yes, I cried at  the end, for what could have been, I was left feeling like there is so much work left undone.  Talent like what MJ had is truely rare, or maybe we do not use our talent.

4.0,"it seems back pain is a very common effect from poor postures, carrying too much weight on one side of the body.  The usual diagnosis is a doctor's visit followed by a prescription of physical therapy.  A little expensive even with co-pay.  We decided to try this dvd since it raves about dealing with lower back pain: not only was it gentle and specific to the area of pain (you can choose one of three sections to work on - lower back, hips and strength training,  All fully explained with another section showing you techniques if you are not familiar with yoga type moves.  Gary Kraftsow also spends 20+ minutes going over causes of back pain, it is not a substitute to a doctor's visit, but self education goes a long way.  We supplement this dvd with some physical therapy sessions (to tell you the truth - there is not much difference in the exercises).  This dvd also provides an aftercare in that you can continue to work at home at your own leisure to strengthen your back and hips.<br /><br />this dvd is appropriate for most ages, but beware that you should not go into the full movement if you start feeling pain!  Listen to your body.",1245514365000,negative
5.0,"wow, wow wow.  I have been working on this dvd for the past 2 months, 3 times a week along with my spinning classes.  As always, Ana and Ravi have created another great dvd that helps me to balance my energy generated from the more aerobic intensive spin classes.  This particular dvd  has a fast pace to the movements that is aimed to generate an increase in energy, but is done in such a way that it harnesses the energy to give you greater inner strength, which I have noticed physical endurance exercise does not do.<br /><br />What I love about this dvd is the section on meditation techniques, which I now use at any time when I feel my stress level creeping up.  The relief is instant and it is important to be be reminded that when you generate energy that you need to channel it in the correct way, otherwise it can be destruction.  hence, again, kundalini yoga really teaches you these important lessons.  Again, I am very biased as I have all of Ravi's and Ana's dvds and have applied their teachings of kundalini yoga into my daily life as part of my overall growth.  This dvd is focused on generating energy ..so be fully present that the movements are faster and longer than some of their other dvds.  All movements are low impact so even if you are not that fit, you will not feel left out in the moves .. just take a breather and come back to it; before long you will be following it and noticing an improvement in your movements.  Thanks Ravi and Ana, I love this one.  this dvd is both great for a beginner and someone who is familiar with Ravi and Ana's approach (although I do not need to preach to the Ravi and Ana followers :-))",1245511537000,positive

Thank you for another great dvd.<br /><br />For those new to Kundalini yoga, it is strongly advised for you to watch the whole dvd and then practice the whole dvd before going into the matrix options.  Reason: Kundalini yoga incorporates a lot of breath work and hence I do believe you will need to incorporate some breathing option offered when you build your own shorter workout.  Again, try it and you will see the difference!  You will need to put aside 1 hour 42 minutes for the whole dvd workout that will take you through the breath work, the targeted release of stress pockets in your body and then the great meditation options.  I always feel physically, mentally and spiritually renewed everytime I practice with the dvd.  The matrix option offered me quicker focused workout in the mornings.<br /><br />the dvd focuses on stress 'knots' in your lower back, hips, shoulders, neck and surprisingly the spine.  The moves are gentle for beginners, but effective enough to 'pop' those stress knots.  If you have severe stress knots, I would recommend some deep  tissue massage as well, but regular use of this dvd has seen a noticable reduction of massage trips for me.<br /><br />I particulary love the stress meditation as we are all experiencing very stressful events in our life that are mainly out of our control.  I am having a very stressful personal experience, and the meditation options have really helped my mind and body some relief from the spiral of negative thought and fears.<br /><br />In sum, the combination of movements, breathing and meditation is the reason why I love the Ravi and Ana products.  The gentlesness of their voices and messages are so comforting in a world that offers the contrary.  For a convert, one had to buy it; but if you are new - BUY it and try it.  I hope you will love the benefits that it will bring to you.",1238339608000,positive
4.0,"I store a lot of stress in my upper back, and although exercising and regular massages really help.  This dvd really helps you target those sore areas!  I really mean target. The yoga moves ,although repeated several times, target specific muscles by stretching and tensing the muscle groups; and boy did I feel a release of the locked energy immediately.  dont be surprised if your back is a little sore the next day - it is a good thing.<br /><br />the DVD is broken up to five parts; if you are into instructions and have not done yoga before - you will find these segments very useful.  For those who are yogis then I would suggest jumping right into the last segments that target the upper back, shoulders and neck either for release or for muscle strenghtening.<br />This is unlike any other yoga dvds that I have ever tried.  I cant wait to try the hip and lower back one now.",1234314683000,negative
4.0,"a dark theme for nicholas cage with his character making money from disposing of bad people (bad defined from the point of the people who pays him).  However, in bangkok, his rules fall apart and leads to a fast moving ending. We enjoyed the movie and couldnt understand the critics poor analysis of this movie.  rent it, buy it, but just watch it.",1231645598000,negative
4.0,"Notice: this is NOT an aerobic exercise program.  The theme of this dvd is to work on your core muscles of your whole body.<br /><br />It is 55 minute workout broken out into five key weight segments and three cardio segments:<br /><br />Weight segment 1: back and legs<br />cardio 1<br />Weight segment 2: shoulders and legs<br />cardio 2<br />Weight segment 3: biceps and triceps<br />Cardio 3<br />WS 4: leg balance<br />WS 5: chest, glutes and hamstring<br />cool down<br /><br />when you are in the cardio and weight segments there are two levels: level 1 and level 2 => different level of difficulties, which the instructor explains one after the other.  This is the bit that I wish they had another person or a inset to explain, because as a more intermediate exerciser, I had to follow/wait for level 2 before I could really partake and often I wished for some of the weights pieces that the repetition was for at least 10 instead of instructions for 5 at level 1 and 5 at level 2.  Although once you have gone through the dvd a few times, you can either do level 1 or 2.<br /><br />it seems deceiving in the first 10 minutes of the exercise whether you are getting anything out of it (intermediate speaking), but believe me once I hit the 30 minutes, I was feeling the muscle burn.  I have tried this dvd twice on alternate dates without overworking my muscle groups.<br /><br />So this dvd is great at home workout with minimum equipment (one set of large, one set of smaller dumb bells, mat and a chair) required, some space to move and jump for the cardio segments.  I like the fact that both beginners and intermediates could use it.  The instructions were clear and is highly recommended for those who have not ecercised for a long time, dont want to be in the gym just yet and need encouragement and can still burn calories without jumping around the place!",1230841589000,positive
4.0,"I laughed so loud when I first it on a plane 12 months ago.  I couldnt wait until this came out for my husband to watch it.  Despite his initial resistance to watch this, he was laughing just as loud.  In fact, I was laughing just as loud and just as much the second time around.<br /><br />it is about a guy who made a mistake with a lady who was very important in his life.  roll on 6 years, it picks up his life with his ex-girlfriend and his kid.  However, another man is now in his ex girlfriend's life, a person vey different from him.  The movie plays out with the interactions of these four characters and mutual friends and family.<br />I love the humor and you might be surprsied how much you will enjoy it, like my husband.  Be surprised.",1224728266000,positive
3.0,"the DVD practice offers two 35 minutes practices, the first covers basic poses like down facing dog, warrior positions and a few hip twists; the second is more to relax and release stress from the body that uses a lot of props like 2X blankets, blocks and a wall.  In addition, there are two 10-min guided practices: meditation and relaxation, which i wished both were longer.<br /><br />Both 35 minutes session were very gentle and instructions were clear.  If you are particularly new to yoga, I think you will enjoy this DVD. I store a lot of stress in my upper body and found this dvd useful, but not targeted for my specific needs.  However, I still got a lot out of using the DVD and still felt the release; but I do need to supplement this dvd with a more targeted stress reliever for particulary bad days.<br /><br />I recommend this dvd to learn about breathing, which is absolutely critical for any yoga practice and the ability to relax, which this dvd does address.",1224696451000,negative
5.0,"what a great script!  I have waited so patiently for the dvd release.  Yes, I am a fan of the show and was so excited with another chance to share 2 hours of my life with these fabulous actors and their life in NY.<br /><br />So Big is back and does he continue to act out his 'lack of commitment"" role with Carrie - this was subtly the best central part of the movie.  I dont want to be a spoiler.  The fans are lead through the twist and turn of the plot.  being a girlie, yes, I screamed at the movie in certain parts- disbelieve and then I cried when the friendship all pulled together.  And I loved the costumes.  Although I am not sure everyone actually dresses like that in NY and I live here.<br /><br />I loved every minutes of the film and wanted more. I hope they can pick up the series again ... with the new phases of their life.  I prefer these characters than lipstick jungle.",1222609507000,positive
5.0,"I am a kundalini yogi and have used Ravi Singh and Ana Brett dvds for my personal use and my health has really benefited.  I got this dvd for the holidays and this yoga really compliments with my personal yoga discipline - it is great for days when you have your period (for women) and when you want a gentle relaxation at the end of a very hectic day.  mind you I am loving this dvd so much I am also doing this in the morning.  I have noticed health benefits within one week of using the dvd.  I highly recommend this form of restorative yoga for those who wants to balance their life.  We all spend too much time racing around and then spend more energy going to the gym ... there needs to be a balance and as much as sitting to read or watch telly is relaxing - this is not the same!<br /><br />the tape covers both theories and practice,  The practice is split into three levels from beginner to advance.  Each has its own poses and variation and I would say there is little difference with the exception of some more advance variations in the advance piece.  Note that you should sit in the pose for at least 5 minutes, this dvd covers it in 10 breathes, which is great for newbies, but I just had the remote to pause that allowed me the amount of time to sit in the pose... this morning doing the advance level (33 minutes on the DVD) with numerous pauses, it took me over 90 minutes and the time just flew by!  I could have been quite happy to sit longer in some of the poses!",1200747938000,positive
5.0,"I am a declared kundalini yoga practioner and much thanks to Ravi and Ana.  I did not start with this dvd, but rather with the ultimate stretch, the fat free and now I have collected them all.  however, I loved the other dvds so much, it did take a few months for me to get around to do this dvd: split into 4 sessions that you can do all in one go or separately.  Total time including meditations is about 180 minutes.  I loved the whole program, a great workout and thoroughly loved the benefits.  Great for beginners as you get a complete awareness of kundalini practice and great for those who have been practicing for a wee while.  Dont be put off that this is an earlier production as you will get the same great benefits as the later dvds.  If you have used Ravi and Ana's tapes for a while you dont really pay much attention to the visual but rather listern to Ravi's voice, which remains the same.  Even if you are new to Ravi and Ana, the production is still great, and you'll end up collecting all of them anyway.",1196102778000,positive
3.0,"Admission One: I discovered kundalini yoga through Ravi and Ana, so I am very biased.  Saying that, Gurmukh has written some great books, especially the 8 human talents, which i completely love.  I wished some of the teachings in the book were presented itself in the dvd.  I thought the flowing sari was very off putting, and some of the camera work focused on Gurmukh when she was not in the pose and I really needed to see the pose.  try it and see if this works for you.",1194626828000,positive
5.0,"For the Ravi/Anna converts - another great dvd that provides two 25 minutes sessions, one for the morning and one for the evening.  Both I would say invigorate your rested body after a long slumber and after a long day at work.  The PM session is a favorite as I dont normally have the time to do more than 25 minutes between coming home and cooking dinner: the real plus is that if I have had a stressful day at work, the PM session really does relax my mind and my tense body, and I noticed my appetite is reduced too.<br /><br />For those new to kundalini yoga: this is not what you would normally expect i.e it is not filled with down facing dog, sun salutations and warrior poses: this form of yoga is focused on breathing, calming the mind and relaxing the body from stress.  if you are really interested in a tool for connecting to your spiritual self then kundalini yoga will be one of many tools that you will find as a seeker.  Enjoy the new you.",1193945096000,positive
5.0,"Yes, I can not believe that this is another great hit and like many other writers on this dvd it has become of my favourite one, to date (still waiting for the delivery of the new ones that have just come out).  It is great that the dvd is broken down to four main workouts (two full 45 minutes and 2 shorter ones at under 20 minutes).  I use the long work outs during the weekend, and I may mix in a shorter workout from another dvd, like the total cleanse.  My body is sure worth the care.  There are always the modified forms and I am still aiming to at least do the full exercise without too many rest moments.  None-the-less, I am sweating plenty and I know I had a great workout ( i am in pretty good shape) so dont be fooled that you are not getting a workout.  Your Are! A great dvd for both beginners and yogis.<br /><br />Also, the work out is also addresses emotional issues/depression/ and with the hectic life style and demanding work place, I know I have benefited from being a lot calmer in dealing with the day to day pressures.  Like many of the writers, below, I have become a kundalini/ana & ravi fan - it is the only form of yoga that I actually look forward to doing, actually find time to do, see great results in myself both physically, mentally and spiritually, and cheaper than belonging to the gym!  I am a seeker and this is one excellent form of exercise even for those who are not spiritually inclined (although it helps if you are.)",1184491394000,positive
5.0,"Over the past few months I have acquired a few of Ravi and Ana's dvds, and this one adds another great dimension and benefits of kundalini yoga.  Typical layout is a good warmup ( a must) and then 2x half an hour exercises.  Part I focuses on the liver and part II is more general but a greater workout of your toxins.  These exercises are not stretch exercises, which the total stretch dvd is an absolute must.  Regardless, I have noticed over the past few months working on these dvds that:<br />a) my energy level has risen (had noticed how much it had fallen since being directly affected by 9/11)<br />b) my liver yin was stagnant and hence my period has been very irratic and painful.  Now the flow has improved within a month.<br />c) stress has been a prominant component of my life in the past few months and the dvd has helped to calm my nerves and remove the toxin build-up.<br /><br />I am busy person and try and do one of the dvds 3x a week with particular focus at the weekend.  The dvds also allow you to do a shorter version if you are pushed for time.  I am usually a runner by choice but these dvds have really been a much better alternative: you feel you have had an aeorbic workout, feel the sense of relaxation and less damage to my knees.  Believe me, I sweat through most of these exercises and I would consider myself to be in fairly good shape.<br /><br />This could well be an great alternative to accupuncture that also works on the energy/meridian lines of the body; and release of toxin in your body without the use of medicines.  A natural detox program.",1184348759000,positive

Why on earth would you mess with something as epic as The Lion King? Bad move there. Hopefully the future releases will omit that awful change.<br /><br />You can play it in the original version, but it isn't easy to get to.

5.0,"I positively loved the book.  The soundtrack feels like classic Fleetwood Mac (original Buckingham-Nicks years) resurrected.  And episodes one through three are stellar, whetting my appetite for the entire 10 ep series.  Perfectly cast and played (esp. Riley Keough in a truly star-making performance as Daisy), I can't wait to binge through the entire series once possible.  Not to slight Sam Claflin (Billy), Camila Morrone (Camila), Suki Waterhouse (Karen), Will Harrison (Graham), or the great Tom Wright (Teddy), but this is Riley Keough's big moment, although she has been around and working for over a decade.  She really is THAT GOOD as Daisy.  The first three episodes already sent me back to the book, which I re-read over the weekend after watching.  It's an absolutely amazing trip back to a period in the '70s and in rock 'n' roll when the music really mattered.  Five Flaming Stars (in tribute to Riley's Grandaddy and his beloved daughter, Lisa Marie) and very highly recommended.  *** Having watched the second group of three, I'm a bit worried about the deviations from the book's storyline and an emerging soap opera-ish undertone.  The actors remain solid and true-to-'70s life, but I'm beginning to have an uncomfortable sense of foreboding as to where the screenwriters are taking The Six's story.  Here's hoping I'm wrong.  Regardless, I'm still hooked and waiting for the next group of episodes.  Hope they're closer to the book's original pseudo-history of this imaginary legendary band.",1678231143182,positive
4.0,"Four years into the Vegas years and with his Hollywood career still on the back burner -- although offers were still coming in, and routinely turned down by Colonel Parker -- touring the show was the next logical managerial step in the ever-illogical Parker rule book.  I re-watched this one fairly recently after playing the big hit ELVIS movie.  There's a lot to recommend here, and a lot of then-subtle sad revelations about the state of Elvis and his career in 1972.  What really comes through, although I'm not sure it was done on purpose, is the isolation of this great talent.  Surrounded by the Memphis Mafia, his father, and sundry hangers on, Elvis appears to be alone and lonely even in the middle of such a sizable crowd.  It's as if living life is his main struggle and he only comes fully alive when on-stage and performing.  Something that has always bothered me was the way the proposed soundtrack (called Standing Room Only at the time, the original title of Elvis on Tour) was cast into the wind by RCA, sliced and diced first into singles (An American Trilogy / The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Burning Love / It's a Matter of Time, Separate Ways / Always on My Mind), and then budget LPs and patchwork album filler.  The proposed live / studio mix would've made a very strong album release, along the lines of 1970's very successful music / concert doc, That's the Way It Is.  Anyway, there's plenty of musical joy to behold in Elvis on Tour, but there's also an uncomfortable underlying sense of 'something's in the wind here.'  Four shooting stars and certainly recommended to serious Elvis fans.",1674107022557,neutral
4.0,"Using recycled studio recordings, low-rent production values, and released by a company on the brink of bankruptcy, Tickle Me, by all '60s entertainment standards, should've been a massive bomb.  It wasn't, however, due to one major asset: The amazing draw of Elvis Presley.  Oddly enough, the picture works.  Drawing on songs from his Sixties studio albums, the soundtrack is one of his best of the era (although there was no LP album release) and absolutely rocks in a pre-Beatles, mid-sixties' way.  In the midst of ongoing Beatlemania and the British Invasion, Tickle Me managed to deliver to Elvis a pair of Cash Box / Record World Top 10 singles (both stalled at number 11 in Billboard), (Such An) Easy Question and I'm Yours, both of which went to number one in the Billboard Easy Listening chart.  The picture itself is a charming, broad comedy winner.  Slapstick and silly (it was scripted by Bowery Boys / Three Stooges writers) and not above poking a bit of fun at the Elvis movie persona, Tickle Me is a pleasing mix of broad sixties humor, upbeat music, and pleasant rom com antics.  The cast (featuring the lovely Jackie Lane, Julia Adams, and a very Jerry Lewis-like Jack Mullaney) is solid, the direction by Elvis regular Norman Taurog is quick-pace crisp, and the musical numbers are very nicely staged by David Winters.  Low budget?  Absolutely, but no worse than many a made-for-tv movie from the same era.  And the picture saved Allied Artists' bacon and was nowhere near the embarrassment level of future turkeys like Clambake and Live a Little, Love a Little.  If you can just go with the comedic flow at its center, you'll find a lot to like and enjoy in Tickle Me.  Four stars and recommended for Elvis and '60s pop culture fans.",1670771724701,negative
3.0,"Perfectly adequate sequel to Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express, which is / was a better adaptation than the bloated '70s Albert Finney, all-star cast version.  Similarly, this Death on the Nile far outclasses the snail-paced Peter Ustinov version of the novel, from back in 1978.  However, both Branagh films, though beautifully shot and produced, pale in comparison to the David Suchet Poirot television adaptations, which are made on far more economical budgets.  The TV Poirot series stays closer to the source material and, probably because of its tighter budget, gets the job done in a far more realistic way.  Less ham and more meat and potatoes storytelling, you could say.  Branagh's Death on the Nile is prettier, snappier, and more luxurious, and it's certainly worth a look.  It's just not the best version.  Don't know what Agatha Christie would've made of the WOKE slant, but I'm guessing she would not have been pleased.  Three and one-half stars and recommended for diehard Branagh / Christie fans.",1670043838861,positive
4.0,"Released ten years apart (1994, 2004), and neither of them an actual Christmas classic, this two-fer works for me anyway.  It gives my Christmas movie loving better half (by far) something a bit different to enjoy, while making us both appreciate the true Christmas classics (you know the ones!) all the more.  Both films have their moments (although Mixed Nuts definitely gets the edge) and they're both quality productions.  No Hallmark Channel cheese being served here, thank you very much.  And at a bargain price, no less. Four Christmas treetop stars and recommended for Christmas flick / rom-com fans of all ages.",1669676002993,positive
4.0,"Beautifully presented in the Blu-Ray format, John Carpenter's ""Elvis"" stands up incredibly well, even in the shadow of the recent Baz Luhrmann blockbuster of the same title.  Originally a television movie broadcast in 1979 (and recut for theatrical release in many world markets), ""Elvis"" takes a pretty straightforward approach to Elvis' semi-familiar rags-to-riches, top of the pops tale.  Director John Carpenter and lead actor Kurt Russell forged a solid working / artistic bond that would carry them through a number of memorable productions over the ensuing years.  This was their jumping off point, and it's definitely a memorable one.  Being shot for broadcast television in the late '70s handcuffed the production in some ways (language, skin, situations), but opened it up for interpretation in others (song selection, biographical musings, career might-have-been questions).  Russell and Season Hubley make a believable Elvis and Priscilla, Kurt's real-life father, Bing Russell, is fine as Vernon Presley, as is Shelley Winters as Gladys Presley, but well-known character actor Pat Hingle misses the mark as Colonel Tom Parker.  Kurt gives a very good performance and is at his best in the dramatic moments.  He's less believable as the legendary entertainer on stage (lip-syncing to Ronnie MacDowell's Elvis-lite vocals).  Most of the side characters are underdeveloped; sadly, this is especially true of the ""Memphis Mafia,"" Elvis' inner-circle group of friends who deserve much more screen time.  The film ends post-'68 Comeback as Elvis makes his triumphant return to the Las Vegas stage, so the largely drug-induced downfall is never really dealt with.  Four stars and recommended to Elvis fans of all ages.",1667173151321,positive
4.0,"Bought this DVD as a gift for my younger sister, the family's biggest Elvis fan.  She's thrilled with it.  Long a favorite in memory, she hadn't seen it in some 40 plus years.  Was anxious to watch it having recently seen the current big hit, big budget Baz Luhrmann extravaganza on the big screen.  She says neither film disappointed, although the new one has much better production values.  Not surprising since this one was originally presented as a television event, on a television production schedule and budget.  But, she says, the Kurt Russell version has more actual Elvis bio info, less of an accent on Colonel Tom Parker, and solid but less impressive musical staging.  Four stars and definitely recommended, with many thanks for the rush of musical, movie, and '50s/'60s/'70s pop scene memories it brought to mind.",1667171409702,positive
4.0,"Four fallen stars for what is included, rather than for what is not.  Would like to have learned more about The Band influence, how and why he hooked with Delaney & Bonnie, the make-up and break-up of Derek and the Dominos, the rise and fall of his relationship with George and Patti Harrison, and his later Live in Japan tour with George.  But there's plenty to chew on throughout this well-done documentary, and the music and clips are all very impressive.  It takes a brutal kind of honesty to admit you're a mean drunk who only thinks of yourself when under the influence, but Clapper does that here.  That sense of honesty can be gut-wrenching, but it's truly necessary to understand the journey of what could have been a lost boy's story.  Instead, he found a certain comfort, strength and conviction through his love of music, the blues in particular.  Strongly recommended for Clapton fans, and to '60s/'70s rock fans in general.",1666708862444,neutral
4.0,"ELVIS as biography is basically cinema shorthand, dubious chronology, and few new facts.  It also lets ""Colonel"" Tom Parker off too many hooks for my taste.  The musical segments, on the other hand, are absolutely fabulous in every way, capturing the eras ('50s, '60s, '70s) perfectly and with dizzying energy, costumes and scenery.  Austin Butler's amazing decades-spanning performance is deserving of all the accolades he's received for his efforts, but Tom Hanks' turn as Tom Parker is much better than many a critic has indicated.  Hanks truly captures the snake-oily character of this scheming carny, indicating by subtle turns how Parker shape-shifted his approach (in dealing with Elvis, Gladys and Vernon, Priscilla, the Memphis Mafia, et al) to gain total control over his one and only client.  You know going in there's not going to be a happy ending, of course, but the wrap-up (especially the hyper emotional Unchained Melody performance) is unexpectedly heart wrenching.  I'm hopeful that the rumors of a four-hour director's cut in the pipeline are true, and that the extended playing time will be concentrated on more in-depth biographical aspects of Elvis's amazing life and totally mismanaged career.  You may not be a huge Elvis fan going in, but you'll definitely feel far more empathetically about him after experiencing this film.  Four Flaming Stars (more bio, please!) and highly recommended.",1663187554899,positive
4.0,"Back in 2011, before broken friendships and in-fighting finally spoiled the CSN(&Y) mothership magic, Crosby-Nash and Company were still creating their own special blend of musical alchemy.  Mostly annoying and often cloying between song (and intro) patter aside, this live-in-concert DVD shows just how good this half of CSN&Y really was together.  It's an interesting, often enthralling setlist, and the band the duo put together is top-flight throughout.  Crosby and Nash are near the peak of their vocal powers, and the in-concert audience response helps to make many of the moments truly special.  Beautifully shot and recorded, you'll feel like you're right there among them.  Four dark stars and highly recommended for fans of CSN, before the fall and ensuing fall-out.",1659668260338,neutral
5.0,"Broad, over-the-top, insanely funny, Animal House broke all the rules back in 1978.  Some 40-plus years down the line, it remains the best film the National Lampoon ever produced.  If you're a fan of the film, you don't need me to tell you how great it is -- you already know that.  This Widescreen Double Secret Probation Edition (kind of over-the-top itself) only serves to make it all even better.  If you like your comedy broad, the laughter rapid-fire steady, and have a jones for the '60s in America, Animal House is the film for you.  Highly recommended.",1656811204269,positive
5.0,"Before Grease (the movie), before Happy Days, before Laverne and Shirley, there was the far superior American Graffiti.  A great film, swimming but not wallowing in heartfelt nostalgia for another time in America, Graffiti started a tidal wave of longing for the old days.  Unlike many of its followers (and imitators) though, it never stooped to please.  Its drama was genuine.  Its laughter natural and real.  Its nostalgia gentle yet realistic.  Nearly a half-century down the line, it still stands up and stands proudly among the best films of its era.  This special edition is very highly recommended.",1656810488680,positive
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my better half, as she absolutely loves the series.  The Humphrey years were her favorites among the Death in Paradise series, and for the most part this one does not disappoint.  The end of the Richard phase (which she also loved) led to the Humphrey era, both of which are well-written and enjoyable.  Since Humph decided to head back to the UK, however, the plotlines and acting have gotten pretty thin.  So, we haven't been as interested as we once were in the Ste. Marie goings on.

I saw it back in the day as an 11-year-old kid with my older brother Michael, and its impact was so strong that it has stayed with me throughout these many decades.  Brando's only directorial effort, it's a visually stunning Method actor's western -- deliberately paced, provocative, explosive.  If you've seen public domain versions, put them out of mind and dive into this restored Criterion Collection release.  Beautiful print, incredible extras. Very highly recommended.",1648397083462,neutral
4.0,"I actually bought this for the 'bonus' disc -- the 1962 re-make.  Pat Boone, Ann-Margret, Bobby Darin, Pamela Tiffin, I mean what aging boomer and big-time fan of Sixties pop culture could possibly resist?  It's cheesy, for sure, but it's the kind of cheese that was aimed at the teen audience of its day, and it continues to warm my nostalgic heart.  The Dana Andrews - Jeanne Crain  version has a better artistic reputation, and it is indeed the better film, technically speaking.  But the '60s re-make is the one I saw in the movies as a kid, so, naturally, it's the one I'm still drawn to all these years later.  In addition, it has played well with family members -- young and not so young -- throughout the years.  Recommended as a bit of fine fun family entertainment.",1648395425743,positive
4.0,"A stellar memory from my youth.  Great good fun for kids of all ages, even if it's just the kid in you.  Pat Boone's high-water mark as a film star, part of a 20th Century-Fox contract players ensemble cast that also includes James Mason, Arlene Dahl, and Diane Baker.  The effects are rather dated by today's standards; even at the time they were deep in the shadow of the great Ray Harryhausen's work.  But it's all good-natured fun, unintentional laughs and all.

I think I was about 11 or 12 when I caught this one on a rainy Saturday afternoon back in the '60s with a group of neighborhood friends.  Back then the popcorn had real butter, the cokes were cokes -- no such thing as diet soda, and the movie experience (cartoons, coming attractions, a short, and the main feature) was magical.

5.0,"A flat-out terrific rock doc on the late, great Harry Nilsson.  I loved it, and I'm a big Nilsson fan going in.  I'm a bigger fan for having watched it.  His backstory was amazing and sad.  His career achievements still stand tall, lo these many years later.  His songwriting and interpretive skills were justifiably lauded in his day.  His big open heart and hellraising legacy remain legendary.  His broken voice never fully restored, yet he carried on valiantly.  Death came far too soon, and the pop music landscape is all the lesser for it.  Harry is gone, long live Harry!  Highly recommended.",1648335275887,positive
5.0,"A matinee favorite from my old Rivoli Theater days growing up in Belmar, NJ.  Any film by Ray Harryhausen was a sure draw in my pre-teen years, and this ranks as one of his greatest achievements.  Great effects, great action, great fun, and Nancy Kovack as Medea -- now that's some great effect!  Recommended?  For sure!",1648334170626,positive
5.0,"A personal favorite from my misspent youth when I regularly attended Saturday matinees at the Rivoli Theater in Belmar, NJ.  Great film then, great film now.  I think I was about 12 years old when I first saw it.  Close to 60 years later and I still love it -- and not because of mere nostalgia.  One of Ray Harryhausen's best.  Terrific video and audio.  Highly recommended.",1648333606115,positive
5.0,"One of Disney's biggest and best from the Uncle Walt era.  Here it's presented as a double-disc version, featuring a second disc filled with extra bells, whistles, and peeks behind-the-scenes.  The film itself is not only a technicolor nostalgia dream, but an incredibly well-preserved slice of film storytelling.  Beautifully shot, perfectly cast, and stylishly directed, it remains a Disney highwater mark.  Highly recommended.",1647300706916,neutral
4.0,"I hadn't thought of this one in years and years, but it turns out to be classic Disney from the Uncle Walt years.  Before DISNEY ruled the world, Walt Disney simply delivered terrific movies aimed at the family market.  In reality, he practically invented the concept of family film entertainment.  This one was aimed at the older kid / teen audience, but its appeal is across the board.  James MacArthur and Janet Munro are a well-cast couple to root for, and the ever-dependable Michael Rennie delivers his usual stern but likable performance.  The location shooting is a wonder for its time, and the script and direction are top-flight Disney.  Definitely recommended as solid family fare.",1647299982354,positive
4.0,"A childhood favorite that holds up incredibly well.  Remember it from Uncle Walt's Sunday show, when it was split into a two-parter if memory serves.  Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter headline a fine cast and the film is sure to hold the attention of adults and kids alike.  Not just mere nostalgia, but those memories of Disney past help make this one a minor classic.",1647299314809,neutral

Great good fun of the ""it's so bad it's good"" variety.  Nostalgia is the draw, pure and simple.  This one's especially good for evenings when you're sitting around with family and friends and you can laugh, joke, and make fun of the film all the way through.  Village of the Giant Laughs, oh yeah!",1646802701172,neutral
4.0,"Great good fun for a lover of old-style Uncle Walt Disney feature films.  Aimed at the teen-set of its day, it gave Annette and Tommy Kirk another shot of Disney box-office magic.  Pure nostalgia today.

5.0,"Fab.  Gear.  Groovy.  Joyful.  Heartbreaking.  As one of a kind as it's subject, and there'll never again be anything as wonderful as the phenomenon that was / is The Beatles.  The perfect example of the concept ""the whole being more than the sum of its parts.""  Will everyone love it?  Probably not.  There are some slow moving-spots in parts one and two (my good wife actually dozed a bit during both), I'll readily admit.  Disc three, featuring the complete rooftop concert -- the final public appearance by the boys -- is the definite highlight, and she stuck with me through that one, front to back.  Very highly recommended for life-long Beatles fans like myself, and for casual fans as well (they can nap or fast-forward through the slow sections).",1646800050608,positive

5.0,"As a lifelong Beach Boys fan, and therefore a lifelong Brian Wilson fan, I can sum up my feelings for Long Promised Road in one simple phrase -- Won, Won, Wonderful.  Wonderful interview segments; wonderful musical moments; wonderful to see the world of ghosts put to rest behind Brian's haunted eyes.  Genius comes at a heavy price, and Brian has paid the cost time and time again.  I think his quote is ""It takes a lot of hard work to be happy.""  Well, he's earned every bit of happiness he's found over these many years, and God bless him for it.  A must have if you're a diehard Brian Wilson fan (or a longtime Beach Boys fan), and highly recommended to all fans of '60s / '70s pop culture.  It doesn't get any better (or more emotionally moving) than to watch a tormented boyhood hero (a musical Icarus, truly) return from his trip around the sun, wings scorched, but still bravely carrying on.  Thank you, Brian, for a lifetime of inspiration.  Love & Mercy to you ... always.",1645993847597,positive
4.0,"A picture I saw in my early teens that I always liked.  I've been looking for a reasonably priced video version just about forever and finally came across this excellent BluRay.  A broad '60s comedy / sex farce, Bedtime Story was re-made as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin and Michael Caine in the Marlon Brando / David Niven roles.  The original is funnier, more energetic, and even seems fresher than the re-make, IMHO.  The cast, which also includes the delightful Shirley Jones as the object of their affections, is not only top notch but game for this genial comedy.  Especially funny is a very hammy Marlon Brando, playing against type and strictly for laughs, and seemingly enjoying himself to the max.  David Niven is his opposite match, as suave and dapper as ever.  Pre-Shirley Partridge Shirley Jones is an absolute delight as the woman they compete to win.  Highly recommended for fans of '50s / '60s star-turn comedy vehicles (think Doris Day-Rock Hudson).",1641010996358,neutral
5.0,"Stoney Burke, ah I remember this show well and with a great deal of affection.  But it's not mere nostalgia I'm talking about, although I'm sure that's part of its draw.  I'm pretty sure it was the 1962-63 tv season.  Shows like Route 66, The Twilight Zone, and this one, were focused on stretching the limits of the still-new medium, challenging audiences, and delivering quality writing, acting and direction.  I was in the seventh grade, just beginning the switch from ""cowboys to girls"" as the Intruders' oldie goes, and Stoney Burke was one of my absolute favorites.  The show's scripts would not only challenge but inspire and educate my young 12- / 13-year-old questioning mind.  Stoney Burke's personal adventures made me wonder about my own life journey and the show definitely expanded my horizons.  Anyone who only knows Jack Lord from his ""Book 'em, Dano"" Hawaii Five-O era will be pleasantly surprised by his subtle, yet powerful approach to Stoney.  Great guest stars and semi-regulars (like Warren Oates) lend Lord solid support.  The generally sharp b&w picture is about as good as anyone could possibly hope for.  One of the high-water marks of tv days gone by, Stoney Burke has held up incredibly well.  Highly recommended.",1640995213679,positive

5.0,"Taut, deliberately paced, beautifully shot, splendidly acted, The Appaloosa is one of my all-time favorite westerns.  Low-key Brando performance is a brooding wonder, so that when his Mateo finally explodes  to violence following the kindly Ramos's (Frank Silvera) death, the impact is intense and unforgettable.  Then, when Trini (Anjanette Comer) asks if he's going back across the border to reclaim his magnificent spotted horse, Mateo wearily responds, ""No, I'm not going back for the horse.  I'm going to kill Chuy.""  It's as if this tired former buffalo hunter has resigned himself to do something he'd never intended to do again.  Brando's stellar performance is matched (in a 180 degree opposite way) by John Saxon's Chuy; he chews the scenery like there's no tomorrow.  The deliberate pace puts some people off, I know.  They would likely say plodding pace; I totally disagree with that.  The director's (Sidney J. Furie) pacing choice allows the story to unfold in a simple, natural way.  And if you can get behind that directorial option, the rewards are many.  Highly recommended.",1635903413187,negative

5.0,"Brilliant.  Incredible.  Brutally honest, but hopeful.  Hopeful in that Crosby is still making music, some of it his best in years.  Decades, really.  Certainly stronger releases than the rest of S, N & Y from the same time span.  His life with wife Jan is both inspiring and heart-rending.  Her comments before the camera will bring a tear to your eyes and maybe even break your heart a bit more than expected, they did mine.  I'm wondering if McGuinn, Young, Nash, et al  -- especially onetime great good friend Nash --  have taken personal stock in a way anywhere near as honestly as Croz does here.  Just sayin', you know; these guys have written a ton of songs about the power of love over the years.  Well, forgiveness is the light of love, no matter what you do for a living.

5.0,"I positively love this film, every single frame of it.  The performance footage is somewhere beyond classic; the actual documentary aspects are of the sneaking a peek behind the curtain variety; and Scorsese's tweaking of the story with tongue-in-cheek interviews of both real and bogus characters is Dylanesque in the best possible way.  With birthday # 80 just up around the bend, Bob's still breaking new ground and way out in front of the crowd in every possible way.  God love him.  Very highly recommended.",1615672226490,positive
4.0,"What we have here is a collection of the best of the Hal Wallis / Paramount post-Army Elvis films.  Presley vehicles, they used to call them.  Familiar plots, lush locations,  plenty of songs, and beautiful girls, girls, girls.  Unlike the cheapie MGM Elvis releases (excepting It Happened Ay The World's Fair and Viva Las Vegas), the Paramount films were made with a certain care, professionalism, and location budget.  The Paramount soundtracks were generally better, too: G.I. Blues (Wooden Heart), Blue Hawaii (Can't Help Falling in Love), Girls! Girls! Girls! (Return To Sender), Fun In Acapulco (Bossa Nova Baby), Roustabout (Little Egypt).  Girls times three would probably have had a better reputation had it kept the working title of ""Chasing The Westwind.""  Did they stick to the formula for far too long?  Of course.  Could they have kept it down to one musical per year, sandwiched between occasional straight dramas (westerns always worked for Elvis), rom-coms, and / or light comedy efforts?  Of course.  That tactic may also have kept Elvis interested, instead of embarrassed.  (Remember his quote, ""The only thing worse than sitting through a bad movie is starring in one -- or in a couple dozen of 'em!"")  Still, there are plenty of high spots included here, and Elvis is at or near the top of his '60s game.  So, if you grew up loving the pop world of the early '60s you're sure to find lots to enjoy here.  Recommended.",1613241052835,negative
4.0,"Watched it last night with my better half.  Excellent directorial debut, beautifully shot and paced, with fine-tuned use of soundtrack music, if a bit overacted at times.  Bruce Springsteen's 1978 classic track ""Darkness on the Edge of Town"" would've made a perfect title song.  Dark, moody, and edgy, it won't appeal to everyone's taste, I'm sure.  But if you like and support independent filmmaking that's definitely a bit out on the edge, it's highly likely that you'll embrace this provocative, yet ultimately moving film.  Recommended.",1595876778047,positive
5.0,"A beautiful film.  Is it biblically correct?  Heck, I'm no expert, but I doubt it.  Who knows, really?  There are the four official Gospel writers (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), of course, but there are also a number of gnostic gospels (Thomas, Mary, et al), so who can really to say.  Mary has been unfairly bad-rapped for centuries as the prostitute who anoints Jesus's feet with her hair, or the adulteress he saves from stoning (thanks to the misguided early Church teachings of Pope Gregory I), only to eventually be canonized as a saint and recognized as one of Jesus's disciples.  This film version takes a feminist approach, which will likely offend some folk's sensibilities, even as it will seem refreshing and make perfect sense to others.  The basics are all here; however, they are told from a different (if no less reverent) perspective.  Rooney Mara (Mary) and Joaquin Phoenix (Jesus) both deliver quietly intense performances, and the film features beautiful location photography and an eloquent sense of time and pace.  For the open-minded family, it's well-worth watching with your older children, but be prepared to discuss it afterward.  Highly recommended.",1587506624992,neutral
5.0,"From a time when tv was still young, risks were still being taken, writers were still challenging audiences -- and themselves, and the future was still in black 'n' white, and seemingly wide-open.  I love the Martin Milner-George Maharis pairing; the last season-and-a-half with Glenn Corbett replacing Maharis is far less satisfying.  I'm not blaming Corbett, who was a fine actor, indeed, but he was playing a safer, less edgy character.  Milner's Tod is the steady Eddie throughout the series' run, with both Maharis's Buzz and Corbett's Linc (as well as an amazing array of guest stars) playing off his generally easygoing, searching intellectual to fine effect.  I only had a vague memory of the series (two guys driving cross country in their Corvette convertible) when I ordered it, but I'm very glad that I did -- because it's so much more than that one-trick-pony image.  Highly recommended.",1586191790989,positive
4.0,"Makes much more sense than the cd release.  The cutaway interviews / insights give the event much needed perspective.  Still, don't go into this expecting the John C. Fogerty of CCR, Blue Ridge Rangers, or the Rockin' All Over the World-era of his solo career.  It's essentially a CCR tribute concert, with a trio of Centerfield tracks and Woodstock covers (ergo the 50 years of the title) thrown in for good measure.  Fogerty's of a certain age now, and despite his incredible on-stage energy, his performance (vocals especially) shows the strain.  Recommended for die-hards, not the casual fan.",1583299436501,neutral

It ends on a sad note, yes; but it is also celebratory, revealing, and informative throughout.  Highly recommended.",1579309364825,negative

Like me, for instance; some of my friends & I attended their PNC Bank Arts Center performance last summer (The Garden State Arts Center, Holmdel, NJ way on back to way back when I first saw the band in concert).  The sound is great; the orchestra impressive; the extended members of the band adept & enthusiastic, and the opening hits set & the encore bookend the main event perfectly. And the three remaining Moodies (Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Graeme Edge) are all up to the challenge of re-creating their most famous LP live-on-stage. The bonus interview with Edge, Hayward, and Lodge is fun, informative, and kind of touching -- they come across as regular, yet incredibly lucky blokes who are thankful for their good fortune & comfortable with their shared musical history.  Highly recommended to Moody Blues fans, big time or casual.",1529034568145,neutral

5.0,"A fascinating look behind the scenes of one of America's most successful and longest-running bands.  In many ways, it gives fans a warts-and-all, fly-on-the-wall peek behind the once mighty record biz PR machine curtains of the past forty years, and it makes for a wild, emotional, wide-eyed ride.  The documentary shies away from neither career highs nor lows, tragedies nor controversies, abiding friendships nor long-held gripes, grudges, and grievances within the band.  Peter Cetera and Bill Champlin do themselves (nor the band's story) any favors by refusing to participate.  Especially sad regarding Cetera, who was such an important member of the group from CTA (1) thru Chicago 17 (Chicago's greatest years), and likely wouldn't have enjoyed a successful solo career without that original connection.  Producer David Foster, on the other hand, would have done better to stay away completely -- he comes across as an unbearable egomaniac whenever he turns up on screen.  One thing's for certain, the surviving original members have never really gotten over the untimely death of lead guitarist/songwriter/vocalist Terry Kath.",1520567063810,negative

Michelle Kath Sinclair (along with her beautiful, open-hearted Mom, Camelia) takes us on an emotional journey of discovery into the world of the late, great Terry Kath.  An incredibly inventive lead guitarist & strong R&B-influenced lead vocalist, Terry Kath was the heart, soul & conscience of Chicago.  So integral was his role & his presence within the band that forty years on, he's still missed & mourned by its remaining members.  Highly recommended.",1520549169983,positive

The filmed show is excellent, both in game-plan and execution; the set list is just fine, if a bit predictable; Clapton's crack touring band offers sterling support throughout the proceedings, and the star himself is an engaging stage presence, nimble-fingered and in fine voice.

Elvis and Ann-Margret make the perfect screen couple in this brief (under 90 minutes) and breezy romp, helmed by the great George Sidney (who had just directed A-M to movie stardom in Bye-Bye, Birdie).  Solid character actor Cesare Danova brings along his subtle Latin lover vibe; William Demarest (Uncle Charlie of TV's My Three Sons) delivers his usual quota of cranky laughs; and Nicky Blair makes a fine comic foil/sidekick for EP.  The soundtrack is one of Elvis' best of the era, a nice blend of original ballads (Today, Tomorrow and Forever; I Need Somebody to Lean On), made-to-order movie rockers (If You Think I Don't Need You; C'mon, Everybody), and the massively successful double-a-side lead single (Viva Las Vegas c/w What'd I Say?).

His third post-army film and the direct follow-up to Flaming Star (the movie many consider to be his all-around best), this Jerry Wald  production offers our hero a chance to show off his maturing acting chops in a Deep South melodrama.  Unfortunately, the meandering script and director Phillip Dunne's plodding pacing betrays the solid efforts of a truly talented cast that includes Hope Lange, Millie Perkins, Tuesday Weld, John Ireland, and Elvis' It Happened At The World's Fair (1963) co-star, Gary Lockwood.  Sadly, Elvis' next 1961 movie release (Blue Hawaii) would set the pattern for the rest of his 1960s film output (a splashy locale in which Elvis finds himself moonlighting as a singer, a dozen or so songs - less and less memorable as the decade wore on, and plenty of girls, girls, girls to romance).

4.0,"Moving into my mid-forties, I am looking to move away from situps and be a little more protective of my back and body.  When I read the description of this product it seemed perfect.  The focus on core strength training and back sustaining exercises was exactly what I was looking for.  However where the video fell very short was in giving me a chance to learn while doing.  I truly wish the creators of this video had spent time setting up each exercise with a number reps so I could follow along and take their advice while I was actually doing the exercises.<br /><br />It is a real loss that they did not include a workout to follow along with as well.  I can see the shortcomings of exercise videos, but there would have been little extra expense to add a decent workout to follow along with. But putting that, seemingly glaring, shortcoming aside, this video was well worth my time and probably worth the asking price.  I feel that I am prepared to put together a back safe core training to prepare myself for spring and summer activities.",1330591927000,positive
5.0,"This movie is just amazing for its visuals. But it does tend to be a little more about ambiance than it is a documentary.  It is more about visual art and appreciation of the beauty of the birds than it is about education.  Together, the music and stunning flight sequences are mesmerizing in a kind of new age way.  If you love birds, be sure to see this movie, but think of it more as a multimedia art museum than as a lesson in how birds migrate. This is not March of the Penguins.<br /><br />The movie is made up of a series staged scenes that place birds in carefully chosen locations.  The captive birds filmed in the movie have been turned into unwitting actors through imprinting on human trainers (who do not appear in the movie.) This technique has offended some people who have seen the movie as being impure. But again, this is an artistic project, the in-flight images the movie makers were able to capture through the use of imprinted birds are breath-taking and would have been impossible without the technique. Although at times the scenes are contrived and sometimes Questionable, for example, Canada Geese and a Bald Eagle descending into the Arizona Desert. (Forgive the moviemakers, they are French.)<br /><br />If you enjoy birdwatching, and especially if you enjoy just watching birds being birds, get this movie.  If you need a tight story line or maybe even a point to a movie beyond just imagery, this may not be the movie for you.",1141971683000,positive
4.0,"I had read all the headlines, magazine articles, and books that came out about Treadwell after his mauling and I never really felt that I could believe anyone's descriptions and opinions about Timothy.  This movie allowed Timothy to talk for himself and for the first time I think I have an idea of who Timothy was.  I still think he was irresponsible and a little over the edge, but actually hearing Treadwell talk was more authoratative than all the other authors who wrote about him (even though much of his dialog was obviously for the camera.)  The result is pretty surreal and often disturbing.<br /><br />Werner Herzog does a decent job of directing the story line and keeping it interesting but occasionally scenes seem scripted or contrived.  It really does end up feeling like a Christoper Guest mocumentary like Waiting for Guffman or Best of Show. He is not a detached documenter, he definitely had his conclusions and pushes them in the movie, but Treadwell's footage tells the real story of a man who is not right with the world yet looking for acceptance, fame, and recognition from that world.  And occasionally the footage shows a man who has been alone too long.<br /><br />I recommend that anyone who has heard of the story, watch this movie.  It will probably just re-enforce your opinions but it's entertaining along the way.  The bonus features are limited to trailers, previews, and a featurette about making the soundtrack which was okay but not something you would ever watch twice.",1141652686000,neutral

1.0,"Now, many people practice poly differently, and the couples shown are but a very small part of a much larger community and practice. However, there are some couples here who are manipulating and controlling other partners, making them feel bad until they breakdown and give in to breaking it off with other partners, or share one of their own partners with others (which that other person was never even shown to have been a part of the discussion of if they wanted to even be a part of that which shows they were treating them like an object).<br /><br />It is okay to have partners outside of your triad or poly group who do not mix into that group or triad, quad, polycule, etc. I understand many of these groups were referring to rules they previously set up, however they seemed to use these to shame and manipulate the partners.<br /><br />Referring to monogamy in such a derogatory manner was shameful. Saying it breaks marriages, and people who practice mono are ""freaks"", that's just not appropriate or a proper attitude to have. Poly people are not better and monogamy shouldn't be shamed just because poly works better for others. Attitudes and much of the displayed behavior here also breaks up relationships and marriages.<br /><br />No one is perfect, there is no perfect poly or mono relationship. It is a lot of work whether it is poly or mono and I think a lot has changed in the community and in people's views how other people.<br /><br />I also saw a glaring lack of diversity which was unfortunate. I feel an updated show would be nice to see with people who have better communication skills, more diverse groups with more diverse relationships because it isn't always a triad or quad. There are all types of other relationships and webs and intricacies of those types of relationships.",1650978971423,positive

4.0,"If you're considering buying Secret of the Wings, there's a good chance you have already seen the first three Tinkerbell movies. This one is a very good entry and fits right in with the others in terms of quality (the second movie, Lost Treasure, is the only dud in the series). The film features fun new characters and big revelations. Megan Hilty (of Broadway and ""Smash"") has replaced Kristen Chenoweth (of ""Pushing Daisies"" and general awesomeness) as Rosetta, which is not very noticeable even if it is a step down. Angelica Houston as Queen Clarion is more featured in this entry, which is nice.<br /><br />I have the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. The TV special ""Pixie Hollow Games"" is included on both my DVD and Blu-Ray disc special features, so I'd assume you'd get it if you bought just the DVD edition. Pixie Hollow Games is 22 minutes and features Rosetta, though Tinkerbell also has a small role. I don't have a 3D player and don't know if it's on the 3D disc.",1357128987000,neutral

4.0,"(Minor Spoilers)<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the film.  Lots of fan service, and even if you never read a Marvel comic book (for shame!) you should enjoy this sequel to Avengers Infinity War.<br /><br />Story & Plot:<br /><br />Based on the comic book of the same name (read the graphic novel, cheap on eBay), We see a few characters from the Infinity War. The film starts on a somber note.  Antman comes back thanks to a rat playing with his Quantum machine in the back of his van.  If you saw Ant Man you would know what was happening.<br /><br />The film depends on you having watched the previous films but that’s OK since we revisit several fo the the past Marvel films.  And it’s no secret that the Russo Brothers use time travel and the “quantum realm” to get back at Thanos.<br /><br />Getting Used to Fat Thor:<br /><br />The God of Thunder has crashed and burned.  Now he rules over the remnant of Asgard on Earth, and loves the rum and beer.  And he’s chunky and not nearly as noble as he was in previous films.  Captain America has not given up hope.  Tony Stark has but gets a wake up call.  Black Widow is depressed but finds her purpose in the film, sadly.<br /><br />And we see that Dr. Strange has brought back all the folks who disappeared though this is not made 100% clear how.<br /><br />Getting used to Smart Hulk:<br /><br />This aligns with the comics in the 70s and 80s where Hulk keeps his intelligence and even wears geeky glasses.  His meeting with the Ancient One and their debate over the time stone was awesome.<br /><br />Getting used to Red Skull:<br /><br />Red Skull still takes some getting used to as the administrator over the Soul Stone.  I wish more was explained here.  Plot thins out here.  And I noticed no more knowing looks and love between Hulk and Widow, now it’s between Hawkeye and Widow.  Takes some getting used to.<br /><br />Battle Scenes;<br /><br />These are OK, too much really keeping track.  You could have edited out an hour of this film and still made for an exciting plot and story.<br /><br />I thought the bravery and ‘don’t give up’ attitude on most of the characters’ parts was relaly well done.<br /><br />Humor:<br /><br />Going back to the 70s and seeing a young Stan Lee was fun – that’s actually how he looked back in the day!  Some of the humor fell flat, other humor was slapped in there to prevent the characters from losing it.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Yes, could have been shorter.

4.0,"A wisecracking man loses his legs to a vindictive doctor and how the guy helped through the love of his special gal.  A real tearjerker of a film, nicely photographed, great acting, though the dialogue a bit archaic.  Really enjoyed it.  I heard that the composer John Williams lifted some of the music and used a varied version on Star Wars.  And it's true!  Listen to the theme, then watch the first Star Wars film, A New Hope.  Nearly identical.<br /><br />Recommended",1555622166719,positive
5.0,"Captain Marvel<br /><br />The Woman, The Myth, The Hero<br /><br />First thoughts:<br /><br />I saw a few glaring inconsistencies with the source material but that’s fine.  This film has the right balance of humor, suspense and hidden intentions that brings it all together for a fun Disney-esque film.<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />Being an origin story, we meet Vers (aka Carol Danvers) who keeps getting flashbacks to a life on Earth and she doesn’t understand why.  This is later explained in the film.  She spars with this man, a Kree warrior, who trains her to fight.  She takes her training in stride.  Much later in the film, she ends up on Earth, crashing into a Blockbuster Video Store (remember those?).  We meet all the main characters and there are a few Easter eggs for Marvel fans.<br /><br />Did you know the Black woman in the film, her daughter was, in the comics, a Captain Marvel character too?  Or the Cat that’s not a cat also was in the comics.  Or that Carol Danvers has played several variations of super heroines?  Fun stuff.<br /><br />Mentors:<br /><br />The story is about mentorship as a running theme.  Carol is mentored by her Kree commander, whom she later turns against.  She’s mentored by Nick Fury, who shows her the ways of SHIELD.  And the Skrulls mentor her in the ways of the Kree, the slavery of worlds.  Amazing stuff.<br /><br />The 1990s:<br /><br />Fun to relate to the technology of the time.  Computer taking forever to upload or download something.  Picking and choosing videos from Blockbuster.  Pagers and Sony Walkman.  Lots of fun.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Great film.  You get a sense of adventure and fun that was missing in a few other Marvel films.  Some ways comparable to Captain America: Winter Soldier.  Stay for the mid credit scene and end credit scene.  You must see Avengers: Infinity War I to understand these final credit scenes.",1554842555262,neutral
5.0,"Aquaman<br /><br />You ever notice sometimes how “serious” critics take these superhero films and chop them to pieces, have likely never read a comic book in their life and more often than not have the imagination of an earthworm?<br /><br />Excuse the rant!<br /><br />First Thoughts:  Super impressive film, very much on par with the Silver Age silliness combined with the modern day badass hero Aquaman.<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />His intro in Justice League was fair, just enough to interest us.  As with most DC films, the characters that seem to get the best treatment are written by comic book writers (Geoff Johns) and have a compelling backstory.  Thus it was with Wonder Woman.  Thus it is with Aquaman.<br /><br />A woman of Atlantis is washed ashore by a lighthouse, rescued by Curry the Lighthouse Guy.  After some fun swallowing goldfish, they fall in love and have a child and name him Arthur, half Man and half Atlantean (I didn’t want to say “merman”.  )<br /><br />Both Black Manta and Orm are in the comics and are both villians:  Manta with his technical superiority and Orm with his hatred of his half-brother Arthur Curry are fuel for many stories in the DC line-up.  In film though Manta’s story, though compelling and sad, is still a criminal from a generation of criminals, thieves and pirates.  He makes his debut in the film as a man obsessed with revenge.<br /><br />Orm wants to use Atlantis’ power to conquer the surface and rise to power as the Ocean Master.  He uses Black Manta as a pawn in his game.<br /><br />The most interesting piece in this “chess game” is Queen Atlanta, whose fate is unknown (until you get to the final scene, no spoilers!) and a few tearjerker moments will make a grown man cry.  Really!<br /><br />Will Orm conquer the kingdoms of the sea?  Will Aquaman succeed in his quest for the one true Trident to unite the Kingdoms, defeat Orm and win the day, the girl and the throne?<br /><br />Guess you must watch it!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  Aquaman was often an under developed character in the DC Comics, up until Peter David and other writers fleshed him out, similar to how Batman was fleshed out from a silly comics character in the Adam West days to the gritty crime fighter.<br /><br />Aquaman is not gritty, losing a fight here and there; but his story is compelling, the action is salivating and the themes of love, family and honor are strong.<br /><br />Recommended",1549674087125,neutral
5.0,"Review, Repeat Performance<br /><br />First Impressions:  A “Twilight Zone”-like film about a New Years wish come true, with twisted circumstances.<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />The movie starts with a gun shot!  Shiela Page just shot her husband.  Someone bangs on the door.  She escapes.  She grabs a friend of hers to consult with her agent John.  On the way to John’s place she wishes she could just live this year over again and avoid this.<br /><br />At that moment she is transported in time to one New Years Eve before.  At first she has no clue what happened but figures it out quick enough.<br /><br />This is the beginning of 1946, and Sheila is an actress in the theater.  Her husband again begins his long descent into alcoholism and cheating on Sheila.  Sheila tries to stop this from happening.  What’s cool is she knows what will happen next, but somehow Fate makes sure things still occur the way they should.<br /><br />Nothing is explained how she travels back on a wish, but it’s an interesting fantasy.  What would you do if you could live your year over again?<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Took me some time to find this on DVD since it does not seem to be in any major video outlet.  Co-stars Richard Basehart of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea fame.  This is his first appearance in film.<br /><br />If you like sci fi and fantasy you’ll love this film.  Play it every New Year’s Eve!",1546457416213,positive
5.0,"Mission Impossible:  Fallout<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />If you want a film that captures the spirit of the original 60’s TV series much more so than the previous in the series, you must see this film!<br /><br />Rated 98% by Rotten Tomatoes, Tom Cruise belies his 50+ years of age and jumps, runs, shoots and has a lot of spy trouble, and allusions to his earlier romances in the earslier series.  But you need not watch the earlier films, it stands on its own.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />After losing a case of plutonium to save his freiend Luther, Ethan Hunt becomes criticized and no longer trusted by the secretary.  And though he “decides to accept” the Mission, the CIA gets involved and puts their own man in with Ethan’s team (Henry “Superman” Cavil).  Ethan reluctantly OK’s this to his detriment as we’ll see.<br /><br />No spoilers, but I thought the story though somewhat slow initially really picks up and with cliffhangers on cliffhangers, takes the viewer on a white-knuckled journey through London, Paris and Kashmir to find out who is running a secret bad-guy organization and get the plutonium back.<br /><br />I liked how things never eally work out well for Hunt.  His motorcycle fails to start when the French police are chasing him.  His helicopter gets shot up just when he’s catching up to the bad guy’s helicopter.  And his former wife shows up at the same place as two plutonium bombs are ticking down to seconds!<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />The movie has car chases, helicopter chases, ticking bombs, terrorists, and masks. Check it out!<br /><br />J.J. Abrams produced this one with director/writer Christopher McQuarrie.<br /><br />Cast include:<br /><br />Tom Cruise ...  Ethan Hunt<br />Henry Cavill  l ...

5.0,"Black Panther<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />I was really impressed with theproduction quality of the film as well as the gripping story that kept you interested throughout.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />I remember the Black Panther character from his stint in the old Fantastic Four comics and later in his own issue, Black Panther, by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.  The movie detracts from the comic in scenery and a few characters are different.  In the comics his sister was a general, in the movie she’s a scientist with teenaged reactions to tradition.<br /><br />T'challa lost his father and is coming to grips with what it means to be King.  After some great fight scenes he gets his dream as King of the country of Wakanda.<br /><br />However an old enemy created by his father decades before in Oakland, CA grows to be a muscle-bound killer.  He ousts the Panther and claims to turn things around in starting a world war against civilization.<br /><br />The rest of the tale deals with T’challa’s reactions to this and how he rallies his friends in a final thrust to win back the throne.  Who wins?<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Great film.  I wish Kirby could be alive today to see his dream come true; an advanced civilization in the jungles of Africa and will they get revenge through blood or change Man’s way of life through beneficial actions?  See the film and find out!",1526072440559,positive
5.0,"Avengers, Infinity War Part I<br /><br />First thoughts:<br /><br />A film of great action, character-driven story, but depends on knowledge of previous Marvel Cinema films to truly follow along.<br /><br />Basic Plot:<br /><br />Thanos in the past has sent his various henchmen, who themselves are formidable, to get the Infinity stones so Thanos can trick out his special Gauntlet, forged from the fires that made Thor’s hammer!<br /><br />Mixing various characters and giving them, some movie time has always been tough, with some directors creating a character alphabet soup of confusing plotlines aka Green Lantern.  Not so Avengers.  From the jungle country of Wakanda, which becomes a battlefield between the hordes of evil and the outnumbered Avengers & allies.<br /><br />Tony Stark and Captain America had a falling out in Civil War and yet the film tries to bring them back in the picture to fight a new battle.<br /><br />The Guardians of the Galaxy come in and not just for comic relief, though some jokes fall short of the whole pace and plot of the Infinity War film.  They fight with Spider-man, Iron-man and Dr. Strange upon Titan, Saturn’s moon as their last battlefield.<br /><br />A side story between Vision and Wanda, the Scarlet Witch occurs, with Vision worrying about what he will do when Thanos comes looking for him to take his Mind Stone.  He doesn’t have long to wait!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  From the deepest jungles of Africa to the space scenes at Titan the movie is a nonstop thrill a minute action film – at least until the end, when we get a cliffhanger.  I hate cliffhangers!<br /><br />Great after credit scene, don’t miss it!",1526072335619,negative
5.0,"Star Wars:  The Last Jedi<br /><br />Directed by  Rian Johnson<br /> Cast (in part)<br /> Mark Hamill  Luke Skywalker<br />Carrie Fisher  Leia Organa<br /> Adam Driver  Kylo Ren<br /> Daisy Ridley  Rey<br /> John Boyega  Finn<br /> Oscar Isaac Poe Dameron<br /> Andy Serkis  Snoke<br /><br />First Thoughts:  I was excited to see this film since I’m an original, waiting blocks for the 1977 Star Wars film.  And I was NOT disappointed!<br /><br />Though Rian Johnson’s story and direction are somewhat controversial in some circles, overall I liked the direction we are going in.<br /><br />We left Rey with Luke in The Force Awakens and find Luke as a dissolutioned former Jedi who just wants to die on an island in the armpit of the galaxy far far away.  And Rey, shocked by this attitude of a man she’s idolized, tries to wake him up.<br /><br />You can’t walk away from trouble and though you may have inadvertently caused it, you still have responsibility to make it right.  I feel that’s the lesson between Luke and Rey.<br /><br />Legends change – we find anyone can use the Force, not just certain individuals.  And Rey has the most sensitivity and the most power, and is on par with her antagonist Kylo Ren.<br /><br />Ren, like Luke, is a torn individual.  He has a Force connection with Rey who communicates with him.  That Rey tries to see Ren’s side of the story is telling and so is Luke’s tale with a lot to do with his relationship with both Ren and Rey.  Flawed characters trying to do what they think is “the best” but eventually Rey decides – in the main throne room of Snoke’s ship.<br /><br />Snoke comes across as a villain who seems to have all the cards in his favor.  His Dark Side Force power is more powerful than Rey and Ren.  They both have a plan for Snoke.  And their lightsaber battle with the Praetorian Guard is worth the price of admission!<br />Forced?<br /><br />We finally get to see a final confrontation with Ren and Luke Skywalker himself.  Luke seems invincible, and Ren wants his blood.  How this turns out with shock you.<br /><br />Another controversial scene must do with the remnants of the Rebel Alliance attempting to escape from the First Order armada and are getting picked off, one at a time, as the Rebels limp towards their base.<br /><br />There are side adventures with Rose (new character, she really steps up and takes the film) and her relationship with Finn – at first seems to have hero worship and later saves his life.<br /><br />Final Thoughts”<br /><br />OK, I’m rambling , but really guys and gals remember this is fiction!  Some suspension of disbelief is required.  Johnson turns the Force mythology on its ear.  And who is the Last Jedi?  Can you guess?<br /><br />Highly recommended!",1514334513693,negative
5.0,"Justice League<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />If you want to be entertained and better yet know something about DC Comics, you will have a fun time watching Justice League.<br /><br />Story & Plot:<br /><br /> Batman and Wonder Woman are trying to put a team together to fight a battle with an invader coming to take over the Earth.  A good third of the film involves Batman recruiting these players and though somewhat spoiled by the trailers of late, makes for an interesting start to the film.<br /><br /> I really wish they gave more info on the characters they’re picking up for those who know nada about comics.<br /><br /> Aquaman, never got the respect he deserved in the comics.  He’s brunette rather than the blonde guy we knew, but Jason Moma (“Stargate”) makes a bad ass Aquaman.  Teasers included showing Atlantis and a cameo of Mera.  We even get to see her flex her muscle with her water powers.<br /><br /> Almost nothing on Atlantis, why it’s important, who Mera is, etc.  I can see an uneducated audience would puzzle on that.<br /><br /> Cyborg, an unknown in a lot of circles, who is part machine, part man.  We see some relationship with his father who saved his life, conflicting emotion – Am I a freak or a hero?  How will I fit in?  Cyborg struggles with this which I thought was a great plot line but then it was not followed up!  Could have spent more time on this.<br /><br /> Ben Affleck’s Batman delivers and his acting and his hot Batmobile and tricks you never tire of him.<br /><br /> Wonder Woman is her usual personable self, a woman who doesn’t put up with the bad guys, and knows Amazon fighting skills and bouncing bullets off her bracelets that’s cool to watch.<br /><br /> The Flash is the most enjoyable character.  He is the viewpoint of the audience, enamored to work with such powerful people, and though he “doesn’t have friends” fits in well with the group.  He represents the hero worshipped kid we all would experience if we were in his shoes.<br /><br /> The way they brought Superman back (that’s not a spoiler, that’s a given) differed greatly from the comics – I guess I was expecting something more spiritual or going to the Fortress in the North to do it.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br /> Yes there are fights, explosions and CGI.  But there is also a decent plot that carries through well.<br /><br /> Not perfect.  Why use Steppenwolf?  But the mid and end credit scenes portend a much better future for Justice League II.<br /><br /> Remember, Star Trek the Movie was dull but the second one was awesome.  Let’s hope history repeats itself!<br /><br /> Recommended.",1511373908659,positive
5.0,"Wonder Woman<br /><br />First thoughts:  The Wonder Woman film had enough info from the comics to keep comic fans glued to the silver screen and those who never heard of her a new look at the DC Universe.<br /><br />Plot & Story:<br /><br />I liked that this film began in World War I rather than II.  I guess we’re tiring of the Nazi character in WWII films and yet still wanted to have German evil genius at work.<br /><br />Themyscra – an island for women only – but their island is invaded by a man – following by a platoon of Germans!  The Amazons are true to the task with arrows buring air and finding targets.<br /><br />Diana goes out into the world of men with some funny results.  English fashion bears scrutiny of the goddess princess and her commentary on the way women (and secretaries) are treated give some much-needed comedy to avoid the dark, darkness of the last DC films.<br /><br />Who Ares the god of War is was a shock and I liked the misdirection.  The film was not predicable.  Loved that.<br /><br />World War I was known for its dangerous gasses that were released during those battles.  My grandfather fought at the front and so I know something of this.  Dr. Poison, a woman with a mission – there is more to her than the film leads on and I would have liked to see more of this character.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  DC did a great job with pushing out this origin story.  Let’s hope they can top this with the Justice League film coming soon.<br /><br />Recommended!",1510183747885,positive
5.0,"Hidden Figures<br /><br />First Thoughts:  Love the title of this film, such a play on words.  “Hidden”, unknown.  “Figures”, as the women in the film are experts in math and numbers.  And “figures” as in notable persons.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br /> The film covers several themes which I found fascinating.  I’ve always loved NASA’s early space program and even what they’re accomplishing now, regardless of government cut-backs they still make something happen:  flyby of Saturn, discoveries on Pluto, and landing on the Moon often which no nation has yet accomplished.<br /><br /> But the historic backdrop is blurred by the underlying racial prejudice of those times, in the South, in the state of Virginia.<br /><br /> Separate sections in the library for whites and “coloreds”.  Separate bathrooms, waterfountains, busses, etc. etc.  This was in the 1960s as Dr. King was calling for equal rights among all races.<br /><br /> The characters in our play are confronting these sitauations daily and it’s fascinating watching them counteract each, as their counterparts tell them that “that’s the way it is!”<br /><br /> The film is based on actual occurrences.<br /><br /> The acting was superb.  The personal sidenotes, such as the proposal of a man to one of the ladies was cute and you’re pretty cold-hearted if you shed no tear!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:  If you want to see why the USA’s space program, after many failures, finally beat the Russians and achieved winning the Space Race, and how a prejudiced South was not enough to dissuade three amazing Black women in overcoming these obstacles, pick this up!<br /><br />DVD has great features and is a must-watch.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.",1494368663000,positive

These events happen while Luke is still hanging out on Tatooine making his moisture farm work.  Who whodathought?<br /><br />We get some cameos of R2D2 and C3PO and even an unwinnable Rebel battle against the Empire on an Imperial-owned planet, to get the plans (as mentioned in A New Hope).  The graphic violence and characters we'd begun to know all pretty much make the final sacrifice to get the plans to the Princess to make Luke possible.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent entry in the Star Wars mythos.  Highly recommended!",1484001907000,positive
5.0,"Star Trek Beyond<br /><br />First Thoughts:<br /><br />Loved the opening scenes with the Enterprise getting some docking time at the newest Starbase that fits one million people!<br /><br />Special effects were great without being overwhelming.  Director Justin Li (Fast & Furious 6) kept the lens flares to minimum.<br /><br />Chris Pine is growing into his Kirk role.  He really got the Shatner vibe down and adds his own flair to it.<br /><br />As I have enjoyed in Trek over the last four decades, the character-driven characters, the relationship between Spock & Kirk as they come to grips with not only the possibility of their breaking up and taking other opportunities but also to do the standard save-the-universe story with some original twists.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />Love the details.  What would the 25th century use as phones?  Would they consider our current hard rock music “classical”?  Right down to the make-up, the costumes, the occasional cars & trains, all makes for a world as real as Roddenberry could have envisioned.<br /><br />It’s a story of revenge, of greed, and of sacrificing others so that you may achieve immortality.  Or so it seems.<br /><br />Action:<br /><br />The movie is a bit too fast paced, and gets to the action pretty quick with just a bit of backstory and set-up.  It got a bit too fast for me, so I had to rewind and make sure I didn’t miss anything.  Illusion weaponry and clever dealings with the bad guy makes this a tough world for Kirk!<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />Tributes to Leonard Nimoy and Anton Yelchin (played Chekov, and recently died in a freak home accident) were touching without being maudlin.  And yes, this film is much better than the other two.  Looking forward to more!<br /><br />DVD:  The DVD, not blu-ray, was devoid of features, just your basic set up of chapters, episodes and future feature film trailers.

2.0,"Update:<br /><br />Sorry that some didn't like my review, but frankly it was a bad movie.  It's only my opinion.<br /><br />About a wine connoisseur who goes on a weekend wine trip with his friend Jack.  Except Jack is getting married and wants to cheat on his fiance.  Jack gets into all sorts of trouble when doing this and pulls Miles into the fray as well.<br /><br />Miles is an insecure wine lover who takes anti depressants and gets drunk whenever he thinks about his two year old divorce, especially when he finds out his ex is getting married.  His friend Jack is a pig who gets girls into bed with him with disasterous results!<br /><br />Overall, good cinematography and you learn a lot about the wine industry, but the unneeded sex images and the clearly immoral Jack make for a tough watch.

5.0,"This made for TV movie was pretty good for network television.<br /><br />Based on true events, the Escape of the Birdmen was in some ways a watered down Hogan’s Heroes where the commandant (Basehart) and the major (Doug McClure) have a mutual understanding and this is not played often enough.  I really liked their cat & mouse conversations.<br /><br />Doug’s character has to get this scientist across the border and back to the UK for research that will create a weapon that will “end the war”, implying the USA’s Manhattan Project and atomic research.<br /><br />Old favorite character actors such as Rene (whom I remember from Star Trek:Deep Space Nine) and Max (from Beverly Hillbillies) with a very odd moustache, and finally Chuck Connors (one of the best Western actors on television at that time).<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Was not as exciting as I remember.  The theme song is played pretty much throughout the film.  Would have been nice to have some musical variety of soundtrack.  Richard Basehart (of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) makes a convincing Nazi (and he also played in a film called ‘Hitler’).<br /><br />Overall a good entry into network TV.<br /><br />The DVD has no extras, just the movie.",1460996204000,positive
5.0,"First Impressions:<br /><br />Definitely a boy/man film.  Angst, excitement, personal conflict, personal conviction, the specific material recognized by any DC fan (Death of Superman, Dark Knight Returns), and a psychotic Lex Luthor who is nearly on par with the Joker!<br /><br />Story and Plot:<br /><br />The beginning of the show with Batman’s origin was really well done, the criminal (Joe Chill?) ruthless; Dad steps in front of his wife and child ready to do whatever it takes to protect them; Bruce running away and falling into a pit – a pit of bats!  Holy Flashback!<br /><br />Batman’s brooding is further enhanced by Lex Luthor, a rich brat who is also a scientific genius, who plays Superman and Batman against each other, via their “secret” identities to get them both riled up to where they want to kill each other. And let’s not forget the pawns in the chessgame – Lois Lane and Superman’s mother, Martha Kent.<br /><br />The whole terrorist theme was well-played, and a beautiful yet explosive car chase showing us what the Batmobile is capable of.<br /><br />Alfred, played by another, more sarcastic character than in earlier Batman films, really knew his stuff and as well confided in Batman and steered him when the Bats was losing his fight with the Belfrey, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />And Superman, conflicted.  Is he worshiped as a god, or is he an alien menace, or just a man who wants to do what is right.  The conversation with his Dad (Kevin Costner especially poignant acting) and the calming base of his mother, Martha (played with conviction by actress Diane Lane) come together in a mix of emotion, love, and heartache.  Quite nice!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />A movie worth watching.  The flashbacks Batman was experiencing while playing back Luthor’s drive were a bit confusing, but overall Affleck’s Batman was characterized in a way that would make writer Frank Miller proud.  The conflicted version of Superman was more real and down to earth a portrayal.  And the excitement &amp; power of Gadot as Wonder Woman made me want a solo film of her so much more.<br /><br />Well done to Zach Snyder, cast and crew!<br /><br />CAST<br />Henry Cavill ...

3.0,"Leslie Nielson was a character actor in the '50s, not anything like his comedy films of later decades.  He's a bit over the top in this anthology of stories, predating Twilight Zone and not nearly as good.<br /><br />He plays a guy who has just committed a murder and wants out.  A devilish man offers him a way out by going back in time and reliving 7 years.  We never see the 7 years relived, just the last scene where he commits the same murder, saying almost the same words.  Fails for me since the TV episode says basically 'don't ask what you wish for' and 'Fate is unchanging' and a bit of a downer.",1447707716000,positive
4.0,"The Avengers: Age of Ultron<br /><br />First Impressions:  Full of action, pathos and humor, not canon but I didn’t care.<br /><br />Storyline:<br /><br />Basically Tony Stark comes up with a perfect machine capable of protecting the Earth.  Or so he hopes.  By sarcastically saying “peace in our time” (alluding to the same phrase spoken by Chamberlain as he signed a non-aggression treaty with Hitler in 1938 – we know how that went down!) Ultron clicks on it and finds that Man, full of the lust of war and greed, decides he will bring that kind of peace, too – the quiet of a graveyard!<br /><br />Special effects:  Great stuff with Jarvis and Ultron.  Even the colors contrasted well!  The banter scripted was at times annoying as Jarvis slowly (too slowly to save himself) realizes Ultron, coming online faster than anyone realized, begins assimilating Jarvis!  Yikes!<br /><br />Evil large supply of robots built by Ultron, flying through the sky.  Only one instance of an exploding fireball.  Always must include one fireball in these kinds of films.<br /><br />Pathos:  The beautiful sadness of Bruce Banner and Black Widow (yikes, what would Kirby say?) was a bit maudlin and sad.  Your girlfriend would probably like this part.  It was “OK.”<br /><br />Revenge:  The whole film was based to a greater or lesser degree on revenge.  Is revenge a good enough motivation for killing?  Only Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver can answer that.<br /><br />Take Over the World:  There’s always an element like that.  Love how the origin of the Vision has changed to a Stark/Ultron hybrid who has none of Stark’s smart-aleck jokes, nor Ultron’s death wish.  Vision was the most under-rated character of this film as he brings the team together.<br /><br />Credit Scene:  In this film, the credit scene is in the middle of the credits, not the end.<br /><br />Final Words:<br /><br />Whedon did a great job putting this together.  He gave just enough to the fan boys to make us wanting more; he appealed to a general audience that does not read comic books (Muggles); and he didn’t overdo it on the special effects.<br /><br />Pro: Dream sequences and Easter eggs.  See the Roy Thomas Band in Cap’s dream?<br />Con: Tony Stark’s bad jokes; Hawkeye’s scenes slowed the film considerably.<br />Great: Stan Lee Cameo!

There are scenes that make you wonder why they were included, but turn out to be key to making sense of the puzzle. If you like a movie that is open to interpretation, you'll love this. On the surface, it's about a wannabe writer (Jeong-Su) who meets a former neighbor (Hae-Mi) in a random encounter. Just when he thinks they're going to get together, a stranger named Ben comes along and pushes him out of the picture. The plot thickens as Jeong-Su starts to get the sense that Ben is hiding a dangerous secret. Pay close attention. There are no throw-away scenes or dialogue in this movie.

It brought many tears and sadness to my heart to try to even imagine what so many innocent children around the world continue to be put through day in and day out. How could such filthy pieces of human garbage even do such vile acts with purely innocent, beautiful children, is far beyond my comprehension. Children are God's greatest gift to humanity. To know this sick depravity is more commonplace than most people are aware of, is not only disconcerting, but it's inexcusable. Educate yourself, do your homework, and then maybe we can all join together to stop this insanity, this suffering that NO child should ever have to go through!! No one!! It's inconceivable, the horrors these children are subjected to. And if they are one of the lucky ones to get out of it, the horrid scars remain forever.

1.0,"I have had a change of heart since watching this series. I used to enjoy watching programs where people would rough it in the wild and loved survival programs; however, the more that I watched the show, the more I was disgusted at the waste of natural animal resources that the OTHER animals in the area that the gameshow contestants inhabited need to survive for REAL out there. Animals are always being displaced by humans, and many of those beautiful animals that have been trapped,  hunted and fished are already in danger of extinction. The contestants which relished the hunting or showed how ""primal"" they were only made me feel disgusted and angry at the blatant lack of regard for life. Many of those animals did not die a humane death. Many rabbits froze while struggling with trapped limb or head, or eaten alive while trapped by predators. Contestants torture and kill animals just so they can get a hundred thousand dollars. Humans are destroying animals and their habitats at an alarming rate. I have absolutely no respect for people who go on a show and kill animals for sport or money. I am sick and tired of greedy society. One day we will all wake up to great famine and disease because how  people polluted and desecrated this beautiful world God gave us.",1630483715226,negative

4.0,"I remember watching Painkiller Jane when it was on the Sci-Fi channel several years ago, and I was sad when it was not renewed for season two. When I found it here on Amazon for $10 I jumped at the chance to have it and have been enjoying it (again) since. It's not the greatest show ever made but it's very different and fun to watch.<br /><br />Based on a comic book series, Painkiller Jane is about Jane Vasco, a government agent who works with a special team that hunts Neuros, genetic mutants that have astounding mental abilities. In the course of one such hunt, Jane finds out the hard way that she is more or less indestructible - after being killed, she wakes up in the morgue and eventually finds her way back to her team's lair where she makes a full recovery in very short order. Over the course of the series, she is shot, stabbed, electrocuted and subjected to all manner of certain death for most people, yet she heals and keeps on going. In addition, she begins to show other abilities that make her even more formidable. There is a catch, though - she might heal quickly, but she feels all of the pain that these injuries bring with them.<br /><br />The series does not focus exclusively on just Jane, though. At different points in the series her team members also get their share of the limelight. And, each team member comes with baggage and skeletons in the closet than make them more realistic than just mindless drones who are there to rigidly do a job with no emotion. Believable and meaningful relationships are built between the team members which makes the show that much more interesting.<br /><br />The series does get a little preposterous on occasion and sometimes the story line gets  a bit silly or uninspired. One episode in particular, ""The Amazing Howie"", stands out as the one episode that I like the least as its story is the least believable of the bunch.<br /><br />The acting is average. This series will not stand out for the acting talent of the cast, but it will not distinguish itself for being amateur either.<br /><br />The DVD set itself is nothing special, either. There isn't a lot of extra content, and what extras there are live on the last DVD of the series. I did not find the extra content to be an incentive of itself to purchase the DVD set, but perhaps others may feel a little differently about it.<br /><br />It's not a perfect show and it does have it share of issues, but Painkiller Jane is a fun show to watch that ended too soon (a problem I have seen with several Sci-Fi shows). It has mostly interesting story lines, good character development and plenty of action. At the current price of about $10, it's a very nice show to have in the collection and is almost assured to entertain. It's a show I will return to and watch again.",1369655056000,negative

I am now watching the entire series, again, on Amazon Prime.  The writing is superb! Elmore Leonard has a gift for creating the most interesting, fully developed, unique, deeply flawed, entertaining characters you can't help but love/hate.

3.0,"I adored Season 1 and could not wait for Dec 30th to roll around to watch Season 2. Unfortunately, Season 2 fell short for me. The story line does not have the passion and fire of Season 1. I think writing the Anna Marie character (Rodrigo's wife) out of the story was a fatal error. For me, the  Rodrigo and Anna Marie  dynamic, as well as the passion he was so driven to inspire in the orchestra were key factors in the success of Season 1.  The writing for Season 2 seems mundane and aimless. However, at the end of the day.....the music IS divine!",1451522949000,neutral
2.0,Season 1 was so intriguing. I was looking forward to seeing how the individual characters and family dynamics developed in Season 2.  I found Season 2 to be disappointing in that every character is choked with over-the-top dysfunction and despair. It is not at all believable. Extremely depressing to watch. I would have liked to see at least a bit of realistic characterization sprinkled somewhere within the 10 episodes. I would not watch a 3rd Season. Not for me,1451404912000,neutral

5.0,"I found this series to be quite riveting because it is based on a true story. The heartache and challenges of the family are just as engaging as those of the 'clients' he is attempting to help. The main character's conflict of belief and commitment to a 'promise to god' made at an agonizing point in his life, is compelling. I was fully invested in the characters through every episode of Season 1 and I do want to know what happens in Season 2.  I am glad this popped up on my Prime recommendations.

That in fact the last place the Ghost of Christmas Past takes him is to Belle's home with her husband & children, showing Scrooge what he lost to his greed.

2.0,"Ok, I admit, when I saw the previews I was really excited about this version. I thought it would explain more from the original version. Wow. How wrong was I? If anything, it totally muddied the waters even more. Unless you are an extreme fanboy/girl who devotedly hangs on to every aspect of the DC Universe's Justice League, and are just a casual DC/Marvel watcher like I am....you WILL be lost. Seriously. LOST.<br />This movie is over 4 hours long. Yes, I typed that right, it's not a typo. Over FOUR HOURS LONG. It is divided into these 'parts' supposedly to stroke the director's ego on how it should have originally been made or something. DO NOT expect this to in any way resemble the theater release. It is as different as the Next Gen Xmen were from the original movies. The sad thing is....it was completely incoherent. It was like a teenaged boy, addicted to his DC comics, was given permission to make his favorite super hero movie. Jumping from plot device to plot device, moving the characters around the board without keeping a straight story board in which the audience could follow.<br />All I can say after MANY breaks in the movie (really, who has over 4 overs in a row to watch a movie?) and reaching the ending, I was a) relieved it was over b) even more confused than I was at the ending of the theatrical release c) wondering why this even had to be made.<br />I know, I know, a lot of the DC fanatics will have my head for this review....y'know what? I don't care. Movies SHOULD NOT be made just to satisfy a niche audience. If that were the case I'd be howling for blood for a DECENT movie about the people of the First Nations (hint; we weren't always the aggressors).",1619206553551,negative

As a girl who loved all things Nautical, it was my very favorite comic (yea yea, let the mocking begin). I had been so excited that DC was going to include an origin story on Aquaman.<br />The problem is that there are so many stories to choose from and instead of just focusing on a single story, they went after multiple story lines. Defending the surface from Atlanteans, the awkward and somewhat racist introduction to Manta, to finding the lost trident of Atlan....all in a single poorly written movie. Then lets not even talk about the continued casting of Amber Heard as Mera. This is another movie where the villain, Patrick Wilson, had me routing for his success at times.<br />There really are a lot of great stories in the Aquaman comic, its a shame that they chose to go with so many at once instead of just focusing on a single one. There would have been more cohesion.",1615122396094,positive
3.0,"They REALLY must be running out of imagination at Marvel. This installment takes place after Thanos snaps his fingers & gets rid of half of the population on the planet Earth. We see people acting like life has completely ended because there are less people. We are to believe that there are no more sports, that noone moved any of the cars that belonged to the people that vanished...they just left them there. That society completely broke down....because half of the world population is gone.<br />Here's the deal; NONE of this would happen. Not the vanishing of half the population, but the complete breakdown of society. With less resources being used up, the reality is that mankind would once again thrive, breed like rabbits and again overpopulate the planet. It's been done before (Ice Age anyone? Aftermath of the Influenza pandemic of 1918 ring any bells?) This mass depression ending in a societal breakdown looks great maybe on film but come on. Anyone with a lick of sense would be sitting there, watching the movie, rolling their eyes. Sure, it's a bummer. No denial there. But come on. It will take a LOT more than removal of half of the world's population to bring about a post apocalyptic existence.<br />Once you get past this fun fact, the rest of the film asks you to truly suspend anything and any knowledge you may have on how science works. This is the world of Marvel....prior intelligence & common sense need not apply. The sad thing is...this isn't even good Marvel. This is lazy pop culture, move along folks nothing to see here Marvel. It's like they are even bored with the flood of super hero movies they released within 18 months and ran out of good ideas.<br />I just really wish they'd waited a bit on the movie & really wrote a great script. Guess we'll have to wait for the reboot for a good Avenger movie.",1614198465951,positive
5.0,"Ok, disclaimer; I adore Bill Nighy. He has been in some cheesy movies, some 'meh' movies and if you wait them out, you get gems like this. Add Annette Benning and Josh O'Connor and you have a quiet yet VERY powerful movie.<br />I completely related to these characters. This was my family. (my father didn't leave he died). I am the introvert in the family so Jamie's character was so familiar.<br />Watching the pain of the end of a long relationship, understanding that feeling was in a way very cathartic. What Jamie (the son) says to his mother as she contemplates suicide was so emotional I wanted to hug my TV to comfort both of them. The poems in the movie are for the most part just gorgeous...especially the one Jamie recites.<br />I'm so glad that there are films like this. Quiet yet powerful. They prove that you don't need explosions or gunfire or loud noise to make a point.",1613229458998,positive

1.0,I remember thinking this was a great movie when it came out - rewatching it as an adult I was really put off by the adult humor and the people suiciding in response to the man's long stories.

5.0,"As a fan of Dave Smith’s podcast Part of the Problem, I enjoyed Libertas. I thought it was funny. Dave is easily the best political comedian today.<br /><br />I want to warn potential buyers of Libertas that MOST of the one star reviews here are from trolls who haven’t even watch or listened to Dave’s special. As you can see most of the one star reviews are from a two week period, most of those reviews were done on 10/12. The poor reviews come from two different groups. One group consist of fans of the Chip Chipperson Podacast. Dave, his girlfriend, and Chip Chipperson, aka Jim Norton, had an incident that really seemed to bother Jim’s fans. They trolled Dave pretty hard. I’m not saying that Dave couldn’t have handle the situation better but there was plenty of blame to go around. Also, if you’ve listened to the Chip Chipperson Podacast, you will most likely come to the same conclusion I have. The podcast is only enjoyable for bottom of the barrel people with IQs under 90. It’s bad. That’s not to say Jim Norton isn’t funny. He really is funny, but Chip Chipperson is a lame and cringy character.<br /><br />The second group of people giving Libertas bad Amazon reviews are the Libertarian haters. They hate Libertarianism and everything it stands for. Irrational hatred based on really nothing. I would imagine most of these people haven’t even watched Libertas.",1509573964187,negative

There are a few short commentaries, but the majority of the video is out takes from the bands very early start in super small venues.  This DVD is not a blockbuster of information, but interesting nonetheless.<br /><br />You can see it online on YouTube for what it is worth, but even the biggest MM fan doesn't need to own a copy of this one.<br /><br />Your money could be better spent buying a copy of the Guns, God, Government tour on DVD.

The sound is great, so plan on cranking it up LOUD.<br /><br />I loved seeing the entire band play with reckless abandon.  They all poured 110% into their performances.  The costumes were great, lighting was perfect, special effects were terrific!<br /><br />The Death Parade film is a behind the scenes look at the band which was fun, except I could have done without the temper tantrums.<br /><br />I have watched this twice already this week, and I will be watching it many more times.

5.0,"I must confess that I get a huge kick out of Howard, and I loved this movie.  This is the real deal, a slice of how Howard got to be the King of All Media.<br /><br />Even if you are not a big fan of Howard, you might still like seeing how he had to fight his way to the top of the pile against mainstream media and the FCC.<br /><br />But if you are a fan of Howard, you will love this movie.  His ex-wife Alison stars as herself, Robin as herself, Babbabooie as himself, and the very talented Fred as himself.  The NBC exec (aka Pig Vomit) is very well done by Paul Giamotti.<br /><br />You will get to see the very personal sensitive side of Howard on screen.  Too fun, and too funny!<br /><br />Although this is a 1997 film, it is still relevant today.  A good slice of the 80's and how we listen to radio today.<br /><br />I also bought the soundtrack because I love the Rob Zombie song The Great American Nightmare that starts off Howard's show.

1.0,"WARNING: BIG SPOILER ALERTS CONTAINED THEREIN! As much as I wanted to like this movie, there were so many holes that weren't filled in, it was annoying and frustrating. The acting is pretty meh all-around and that bucktoothed kid with the braces from AHS was irritating to the point where I wanted him to meet his demise. The fathers who are at odds because of a tragedy were ultra lame and had specific unexplained contention until toward the end. It's like they thought the people who made this movie thought that quick conversations between two characters under the stress of the circumstances were all that were needed to conclude the movie. When a kid can have a brief conversation with an alien to appeal to its humanity and save the town/world was ridiculous. While that ending pretty much sucked. It was a good premise, but that ending was a wannabe Encounters of the Third Kind without any resolution. J.J. Abrams and especially Stephen Spielberg, who should've know better, should be ashamed for releasing this piece of trash before cleaning it up. I also felt that casting boys as heroes and the casting girls as people who need to be saved was pure sexism and it was an insult to the viewer. I don't care if this took place in the 80s. It was a horrible precedent to set.",1620044074257,negative
5.0,"While this is a very powerful, very disturbing and upsetting show to watch, it is necessary to understand how destructive hate is. The world is ugly and in 2021, Black people are still dealing with this horror on a weekly basis. It's on the news everyday. It's on the news so much, it's been normalized - but it's anything but normal. We need to admit the hatred white people have fostered in this country against Black people, especially because it's presently being enflamed by embittered fearful white old school racist politicians who only want to bring the country back to the 1950s where white people rule. These hateful people sow the seeds of hate, which makes movies like this necessary. I hope people use this show to educate themselves and sow the seeds of love and peace instead of hate and division. We need to confront and learn from our past to move onto a better and inclusive world where everyone can get along and live together in peace and harmony.<br /><br />I want to point out that this is a horror movie BECAUSE it it absolutely horrifying. From the 1-star review comments that denounce this show because it's racist are missing the point. They are offended because this is based on reality, not fiction. The people who denounce that this is from the horror genre clearly don't understand because their view is myopic. This is filled with monsters, but they're not fictitious monsters - they're real and they wear the face of white people. I suggest those commenters look within and ask themselves why they feel this way. This show is more of a view into how Black people feel everyday because they are still subjugated by white society.",1618919676283,positive

5.0,"This was a weird one, but I really loved it. I'm a big fan of the animation and liked the story a lot. The acting was great. It was a little hard to watch at first when I viewed the troubled main character, but she's a lot more complex, braver, and smarter than some viewers give her credit for. She's personified the things she's going through and starts the long road to heal by investigating more about herself, her father, and the people in her life, both the good and the bad. I like that it doesn't just concentrate on the main character. Learning more about her family and her boyfriend in depth versus what's on the surface shows how much her family is negatively affecting her life, especially in her current state of mind. She goes through self discovery, which is a challenge for her as she suffers from PTSD, but it is real. As she looks for who killed her father, she knows things she wouldn't know if she was just suffering from mental illness - there's more than that going on.",1617028462020,positive

Their performances are absolutely outstanding, especially since they each play multiple different unique characters. The supporting cast is filled with top comedy performers. Leslie Jones is hilarious and goes all out. The whole movie is over the top, which is what makes it so awesome. It's heartwarming, but not in a cheesy way. I would definitely suggest watching the first movie before this one because the journey from the past to the future is relatively seamless and totally relevant to the current world we live in today because, and I hate to break it to you like this, but it's no longer 1988.",1615722349446,negative

5.0,"When I got a free trial of Amazon Prime, this was one of the first shows I saw. This show has the witty, the nitty and the gritty.. It's funny, but it's also got real life drama. I love the wide range of characters and the sub plots, so it's not just focusing on an aspiring young white Jewish comedienne and her family. Some of the characters and annoying and unnerving, but that's what sucked me in. There's authenticity and genuinity there. And I like that the cast of characters get more diverse - more real - than other period shows I've seen. (Still, there are a lot of white people, which I do think was a sign of the times.) Maybe not everything is on the mark, but I think it serves to show the changing of society. Mrs. Maisel is an isolated white woman in Queens whose world is expanded as she chases her dream of being a comedian who struggles with getting acceptance, especially when her parents don't take her seriously. (I'm sure a lot of people can relate to that!) She starts working with people of different backgrounds, colors, ethnicities, and creeds and she just goes with the flow because hers is a human story that is continuously both shrinking, blooming, and changing - not just for her, but for everyone. These people help to support her and in turn, she supports them without judging them. The only thing that's I'm a little put off by is her treatment of the men in her life, especially the good ones. She sabotages herself when she really doesn't have to.",1611233374195,positive

By the beginning of season 3, I had a serious crush on Hamish.  This is definitely a chick series.  It will make you want to move to Scotland (assuming you can stand the weather) and find your own little Scottish town.  I don't think this series is for you if you're under 40, but for those who aren't, or who have a connection to England/Scotland/Ireland, it's great.  The characters are very real, and all are people you'd want to know and hang out with at the pub.  There is a ""mystic"" side to this series that I haven't seen in others, that is really interesting.  Sad, funny, endearing, I highly recommend this series to the right people. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was worth 5, but I took one off because I don't think it's for every age or sex.  My only regret is that there aren't 3 more seasons.  P.S.

They were great.  They were all entertaining in their own way.  It was a relief to have a cop show where the wife is (as usual) fed up with his schedule, but their marriage is happy anyway.  I watch shows like this to escape from reality, and it's nice to not have to endure somebody else's bad marriage for a change.  I thought the murders were creative, the cast in every episode was great, the scenery was beautiful, the acting was perfect, the writing was perfect, and I didn't really care who did it, because I enjoyed the getting there so much.

I watched all 6 seasons, but there was no resolution to many long-time situations.  The men are all incompetent and the women are all really angry and borderline verbally abusive to the men.

Rather than focus on the decorum of the English Rose, this story focuses on her wit and the power of her many personas as she evolved into a supremely competent ruler.  She showed the world that not only could a woman rule, she could reign.  So many memorable scenes.  Tom Hardy was the best casting choice to soften the strong portrayal of Elizabeth.  The scene where they were dancing, both in real time and in remembrance were so touching.  The laugh after she berated her council for relentless pursuing a &#34;match&#34;/stud for the succession, was probably my very favorite scene.  I laughed out loud!",1506051677189,neutral
4.0,"Martin Clunes is so subtle and natural in this performance.  As is generally the case when he arrives on screen, he steals the show.  I'm not a Holmes fan, not really my genre, but I watched it because of Clunes and I am surprised to say that I liked it.  There was little of the egotism that accompanies Holmes.  Doyle is challenged by his own faulty assumptions but, with the aid of his companions, he moves beyond them to find the truth.  It's a believable and interesting period piece.  Holmes fans may be disappointed by the lack of narcissists but not in the clever construction of a good tale.",1491703079000,negative
4.0,"An engrossing story with some great staging make this a fun series to watch.  The acting is good even if the script gets a bit like Reign with all the self disclosure, rationalizations and justifications.  There aren't many excellent shows about the issues of male friendship so I am glad this series made the attempt.  It is a layered story with lots of twists of fate that conspire against just about everyone involved and smart enough to keep you guessing.  All of the characters are flawed and unlikable almost in turn.  The complex interplay of their egos against their need to cooperate to survive come to the fro from incident to incident which kept me watching.  Unable to rely upon the myth of American Individualism to squirm out of this tight spot, they are trapped into trusting when they know themselves to be untrustworthy.  Overall, it is an impressive piece of work!",1491685611000,positive
5.0,"OOO, this is just great!  Warning, it is as hard to follow as a paper street map of San Francisco ;), but well worth hanging in there because something interesting is guaranteed to grab your attention.  The acting is simply first class and the story is just perfect.  Just when you think you understand some little piece of it, something comes along to add to the confusion and you just have to wait and see how it will influence the story.  It is what a great story driven production is capable of when allowed to see the light of day.  I am so glad this one made the cut!  Perlman and Delany are both at the top of their game in this production. Dillahunt brings back memories of the most despised character in Deadwood (where he was also outstanding!).  I love it and hope it makes it to the full telling of this gripping and emotional series.",1491294241000,positive
5.0,Wow.  This is simply excellent.  I just love the way the story is told and Jared Daperis is perfect for the debonair criminal of post WW I Australia.  The narrator kindly prepares us for what is to come and helps us understand the powerful psychological and sociological forces influencing key characters in a manner that keeps you sober.  Fantastic!  This stands out as one of the very best.  What a great series.  I am glad they included this fascinating character for season 6.  What an achievement!,1491293419000,positive
5.0,"Wildly eclectic story that doesn't fit neatly into any particular genre and is sure to find a niche audience who will just love it.  More like a spy drama than a crime story, it attracts viewers who like character studies as well as intrigue.  It requires your patience, your attention, and a willingness to be wrong as you make predictions about what happens next.  The story is so skillfully layered.  It mainly focuses on the frailties of the powerful and the dynamics of the selfish and self serving people they attract but there's so much more to it.  I just LOVE it.  Of course, the acting is excellent.  The Harris' are cast with perfection.  The tweeking preacher is a stroke of genius as he is an all too common reality.  I suspect his delusions will enter into the story as they develop along with his addiction, ooo.  The writers are so much more clever and courageous than most and I hope I am not made to wait in vain for the completion of the story.  It is one of those tales that is full of surprises.  It is just too good to drop!  Niche audiences matter too, ;)  I am sure that a production like this has staying power.  The story is unlikely to ever become irrelevant or dated.  While the masses aren't flocking to watch it now, it is a story that can continue to find an adoring audience over time.  I hope this will be taken into consideration when making decisions on the future of this production.",1490569426000,positive

The writers give the actors the opportunity to develop flawless characterizations.  The cinematography, staging and settings are perfect, of course.

3.0,"Typical, shallow documentary about an English royal.  Oddly enough, I was expecting it to contain more about him: how he adapted to the seeming effeminate role of King Consort would have made it interesting.  Otherwise, it is much like the pedigree of a fine stallion on film.  I sense he is a far more interesting person than this documentary presented.  From my recall of various events and instances where we have been given access to his thoughts and deeds he is rather hilarious in a quintessentially British way.  Observant, irreverent, quick, sporting, and lets face it, absolutely DASHING; that's what I was hoping would be highlighted.",1481266100000,neutral
5.0,"Still suspect about the choice of Ms. Cyrus to play the revolutionary.  On the one hand, she will attract an important and large following of young minds.  This would make the choice clever.  On the other hand, the chemistry between the actors, which is always right on in Mr. Allen's films, is challenged by the Disney camera style that Ms. Cyrus is accustomed to.  The writing is pure Allen and there are, as always, many quotable and memorable moments that make this a really fun watch for those of us who love his openly neurotic, pensive and ultimately hilarious creations.  Love this one!",1475677439000,positive
5.0,Sorry is compelling and relevant.  There's an artistic quality that separates it from other stories of organized crime and government corruption setting it above the crowd.  I appreciate the rather undramatic approach taken to the violence.  Paired with displays of hedonistic self indulgence.  It allows us to think through the event rather than just a simple viceral respnse to blood and guts.  Well done!,1474251570000,neutral
1.0,"Oh, my.  The gun loving egotist takes on science now.  Creationism has been crammed down the throats of a fearful Jane and John Q Public for more than 2000 years and many a scientist and healer has been murdered by the religious elite for helping us get off our knees and participate in our world.  It is the religious community who is force feeding their false doctrine, and, as they have done historically, they play the victim.<br />For hundreds of years, only the clergy were allowed to learn to read, write and perform experiments to better understand the nature of reality.  In industrialized parts of the world, almost anyone can read now.  That was a hard won fight.  Religion and science don't have to be enemies.  Scientists aren't calling for the end of Christianity.  Simply because science doesn't support religious stories, doesn't make the scientist the bad guy here.  Religion has a long history of the intentional misuse of information as it was once the major force of political power, created to keep you on your knees in service of the Lord, the King/Queen and the Pope.  Much like the Middle East today, only their mind control is Islam.<br />Science doesn't attack religion.  Religion is the bully here.  Science only illuminates.",1472014770000,neutral

2.0,"Just don’t do it. I think I may have killed a few brain cells with this one. The opening credits should have been warning enough (3.5 LONG minutes of them). I don’t think I have watched an opening credit sequence that long on a movie made since before the 90’s. It doesn’t get better from there. This is the type of B movie that appears to be shot over a summer break. The actual sharks appear to be made of clay or stone as if they were a school science project and then superimposed on the screen. 80% of this film is shot under water so the director does a lot of these long swim sequences which are WAY way to long and boring and clearly serve no purpose other then eating screen time. Flash moments of black screen, red tinted water over and over meant to be dramatic are eye roll inducing and over used. The amount of screaming done by these young ladies while under water in scuba gear would  almost guarantee they die from lack of oxygen long before the sharks get them. The final five minutes where the last two women standing swim through chum and a group of great whites to get to a boat, defies every law of reason and survival. Was there a reason they couldn’t swim along while hugging the coast and look for a shore or a rock to climb on...? I tried to suspend my disbelief, I really did, but the only thing that gave this movie two stars instead of one was the underwater city. The parts that weren’t too dark and obscured by flashes of light were actually pretty well done. The end result however isn’t worth it unless you really like watching bad movies or want something to put you to sleep, just don’t do it. I’m telling ya! 😬👎🏻😂 If you want an underwater creature feature with far superior underwater footage and some actual story, try The Cave.",1606846585836,negative

To my additional suprise Sam Worthington (whom I had never seen before) in my opion was as good (if not better than) Christian Bale in his role as Marcus Wright. His character was so believable, you find yourself cheering him on, wanting him to survive. MCG did an excellent job with this movie!

5.0,"Despite the fact this series airs daily on a channel in my cable package, I still purchased the series.  This DVD collection is WAY better quality than the channel it airs on-better picture, sound,  and color.  Some of the episodes on TV cut out scenes due to time constraints-that isn't an issue with this set and no commercials to watch either~<br /><br />If you're not familiar, this is wonderful series about the jobs involving paramedics, firefighters, doctors and nurses.  The actors are fantastic and its quite obvious a lot of time and training (to make them look like real paramedics/MD's/nurses/firefighters) was invested throughout the series. I don't want to give anything away for those watching this for the first time. So I will just say keep in mind the series is 50 years old, not all stories have a happy ending, HOWEVER I do think its appropriate for most age groups, you don't have to worry about nudity or cursing.  And keep your eyes open, you''ll spot some celebrities who guest starred on the show (John Travolta!) over the seasons.<br /><br />Highly recommened-WKMG365!",1665965989516,positive

Apparently, despite the description stating &#34;Digital Copy Expiration Date: December 31, 2017&#34; and all of the reviews claiming Ultra Violet/digital copies of the films are included.. there are, in actuality, NO such codes. At least, not in the box that I received. Needless to say, I am returning this set. Not because I want to, as I do love these films. I simply do not like paying for something and not getting everything that I was led to believe I would be receiving. For me, this is about principle.. I don't appreciate being misled.

The characters are very well developed over the seasons, making you feel like on of the BAU family and more than happy to welcome them into your home every week.

5.0,This was a wonderful movie that my husband and I discovered on a whim one night when we didn't have anything else to watch. The plot and characters drew us in from the start. Very intriguing! It led me to the book series which I completed in a matter of weeks. I was very excited to see the other books made into movies but was heartbroken when some internet searching revealed that someone somewhere had deemed the first attempt (I am Number Four) a failure and that no more of the books would ever see the silver screen. I do not agree that this movie was a flop or failure and truly hope to one day see the entire series made into movies.,1391644963000,neutral

We taped it when it originally ran on TV the one time back in the early 1990's and have since worn that poor VHS tape out. Luckily, it was released on DVD a few years later and now it was time for me to have a copy in my own home. This lovely story teaches a timeless moral that every person should know and is told as only Opus n Bill can.

If someone has not read the book, I think they will be very confused by what is going on as this movie ponderously limps along at a snail's pace.<br />In the book, she is in constant pain due to her surgeries and most of the men she meets, deserve their fate. This movie dragged to the point that I wanted to scream, but I kept watching it for some sign of redemption... But none came. She wasn't even what she was supposed to be at the end.

He should've been one of the admirals riding a desk..... good job Jon Hamm in his role though.<br /><br />Wayyyy too many unoriginal references to the original.  Was kind of embarrassing to watching Tom shirtless (though he looks great) playing football with the young guns.<br /><br />One last and very important thing:<br />Please, please, please turn the camera around in the dog fight scenes!!!!  All we saw was the pilots crashing against the windows side to side in ""the box.""  I want to ""see"" what the pilot sees, and feel the rush of the ups and downs of violent flying!

The movie makes no sense whatsoever - and frankly seems kind of lazy.  Animation did all the work.  There’s no coherent storyline - it’s like the writers said, “Here!

5.0,"I like Magnum P.I. I really do. I paid for this show for one reason and one reason only. I couldn't find a way to watch it anywhere else. You see, it ties in with an episode of ""Murder She Wrote"", and I wanted to see the whole story. So, it was worth $1.99 to do that. We already subscribe to too many streaming services, at least two of which could include ""Magnum P.I."", but for some reason don't. I guess the bottom line is that I don't like Magnum P.I. enough to pay as much to watch a season of it as I do to be able to watch the complete series of thousands of other shows. Copyright owners need to wise up. They'd make more in the long run licensing shows to streaming services, instead of charging us to watch an episode, or a season.",1608934941993,negative

PBS' recent version w/ Patrick Stewart was great, but this new one just blows them all away.  Kurzel the director took big risks that pay off.  He adds scenes that Shakespeare didn't write (funerals, coronation), but they become crucial to this version.  I love how Birnam Wood &#34;comes&#34; to Dunsinane Hill !  I love the new impetus for Lady Macbeth's unraveling.",1482801353000,positive

5.0,"I saw the most recent 'Elvis' movie (of 2022) and it reminded me of the original Elvis movie that I saw when I was a kid. Low and behold, the movie of my youth is available on Blu-ray and in a quick 48 hour Prime member delivery (and due to modern technology) I now have my own copy of that long-ago flick. I picked an evening when I knew I had a good 3 hours of uninterrupted time and put it on to play. Such a great movie -- even better than I remembered. The relationship between Elvis and his mother is emphasized in this movie and I have to admit that I got a little misty-eyed more than once while viewing it. If you're not a huge Elvis fan you will still like this movie, but if you are a fan of 'Suspicious Minds' or 'In the Ghetto', you will LOVE this movie! Watch this, and you will thank me later.",1666777660947,positive

It may have only run for one season, but it has imprinted itself on the hearts of millions. Part western, part futuristic space exploration, and all about the good guys versus the bad guys, Firefly has something for everyone. There are 9 very diverse characters, all with very different backgrounds. What binds them together is the need for freedom, which they find on Serenity, the ship they live and travel in together.

1.0,"Watching this movie is like watching a very long trailer instead of a movie.<br />Obviously you can't fit the entire Bible history in such a short time, but why use up time on fake action scenes (ninja-like fighting angels in Sodom) instead of mentioning actual biblical occurrences (Esau, Jacob, Joseph, golden calf) just to mention a few.<br /><br /> What I've learned so far:  God only speaks to certain people secretly, those people are NEVER motivated or inspired enough to share His message with others (Isaac didn't seem to have any idea who G~d was) and it's much better to let your family think you're nuts instead of just explaining what God told you. Hey, sensationalism sells- right?  Women are clueless, faithless nags, and must always have dirty faces (shame on you Roma.) And for some odd reason, all middle eastern people speak with heavy British accents.<br /><br /> What little subject matter you do get in this movie has been censored and repacked to come off as politically correct as possible, so as not to offend anyone, yet fictionalized enough to hopefully reel (no pun intended) the average teenager/unchurched person into  reading the Bible. However, good intention doesn't make up for lack of accuracy.<br /><br /> Yes, it's totally understandable that you can't explain the entire Bible in such a small time frame.

4.0,"Living a short distance from Tombstone and having been there numerous times, let me just say that much of what is suggested in the movie is Hollywood. There was a number of poetic licensing efforts done to make non-fiction and fiction blend into one storyline. The issue barely touched upon in the movie, is in that era the use of the word &#34;cowboy&#34; to describe someone was as demeaning as calling them a S.O.B.! Ranchers hired hands were typically referred to has herdsmen or graze help. Tombstone isn't about a sheriff coming to town kicking butt and takin names. Instead it suggests the brothers along with Doc Holiday were more reserved and laid back. However you get a quick understanding that a certain Earp brother could be quickly upset if anyone entered his personal space or dare lay a hand on him. The movie took plenty of poetic licensing opportunities however through the entertaining sprucing up, most of the movie gave a close account of events as I have learned them through history research on the town and it's people now and then!",1402324652000,neutral
4.0,"The Gangster Squad, is in no way elegant w/suit and tie as Elliot Ness. The action was plenty and the squad took a few black eyes for the team. As was the protocol of early day policing in Los Angeles or any city where low level thugs tried to appear in charge of a high level extension operation. What is unique about the Gangster Squad is it tells the story honestly. I includes the mistakes that were made, it shows how some of their own guys got made and how if you can find the bad guys hangout...you can be damn sure they can find yours. Overall the movie was entertaining. As a disclaimer: for retired lawmen there may be some sense of &#34;crap I've done that&#34; while for the average Joe it may however be hard to make just a connection, that is ok if you don't you never will understand it...because its a cop thing.",1402322744000,negative

5.0,"The movie was opened with the recollections of prohibition and revenuers, Feds and local lawmen who could be bought off. It spun even tighter as a grip is squeezed on a community by far reaching government interests. As a family struggles to maintain their standing in the community (not financial) as social strongholds prices will be paid and fire will be fought with fire. The show is gripping, maintaining attention right up to the last of the credit rolls, because as long as the movie is still rolling...anything could change by the time the &#34;grip holder&#34; credits appear.",1402319142000,positive
4.0,"Ace in the Hole, is a classic. Loaded with flashes of the past. From political correctness to social norms, the film is a study of progress a society has made.

The Mexican Spanish speaking actor the Father of the Bride he was really funny. The other guy the father is black father is a actor I've seen before. Those were pretty good. And the bride and groom did a pretty good job as well. Not the greatest but it was fine. I think the mail groom actor should have been a little more polished and I know there's a lot of black actors out there that have education and speak clear and articulate but this particular groom actor wasn't the best pic.

1.0,If you are a Christian -- don't watch this.<br />I was hoping for a comedy but instead for some reason the directors allowed a low class ghetto trashy mouth actress I've never seen before and you can figure out which one that is immediately. This movie was absolutely embarrassing for the black community. I can tell you one thing if I had friends like some of these women who needs enemies. Not only was it not funny it was trashy every other word was the F-bomb and other nasty garbage trash mouth from Hollywood. Again it really made the black women look horrible. Any classy movies that star black women? This certainly was not one of them. Jada Pinkett Smith almost showed the best class of the show but then they put in that terrible scene with her having sex with some stranger. Who in the World created this horrible story. This is just complete trash. Don't waste your time.

2.0,"Why on earth does this have such high reviews? Are people really this easily entertained?<br /><br />This movie was inexplicably both over the top ridiculous and totally boring--somehow at the same time.<br /><br />Jack Sparrow was over the top. He spent most of the movie acting seriously drunk with none of the charming, funny character that he's had before, so it was just cringy and gross.<br /><br />Will's son is generic and boring. The girl--whatever her name was--was over the top obnoxious in her haughtiness. She's completely and utterly brilliant--a super smart scientist!--can't any of you plebs understand? She's taken for a witch instead. Ok, whatever. I got over her character after the first 20 minutes, but she never let up on it.<br /><br />Most of the movie was just boring and it repeats Dead Man's Chest (almost down to the name! For Pete's sake!). At least in Dead Man's Chest the villains were actually cool and interesting. I thought the decaying sharks were kind of neat, but everything else about the villains was lame.<br /><br />Barbosa's story was the only really mildly interesting part of the movie, and it didn't play a very big part at all. That's a shame. Honestly with the way Jack acted in this movie it would've been nice to center it around Barbosa instead.<br /><br />I didn't mind Pirates 4--I even liked it more than number 3---but this one makes me hope they never make another one.",1612300580103,neutral

2.0,"I enjoyed the book. I've read it a few times now. I tend to pick it off the shelf when I want a quick read that is a stand-alone book rather than getting enveloped in a multi-book long series. I like the story and the concept.<br /><br />But the movie fell way flat. The awful acting is disappointing. The choices for actors was even worse--the only character who actually fit their role was William Hurt who was perfect for Jeb. They chose people who looked absolutely nothing like the characters in the books (the Seeker most of all) and Jared and Ian look too much alike and it's hard to remember who's who. I had to remember that Ian was the guy that looked like a redneck and Jared was the wannabe hottie but also looked like he was straight out of a trailer park. Which is fitting, I guess, since in a memory they should've been living in a cabin in red rock canyon country and instead they're in the middle of a meadow with a literal tin can TRAILER instead. What, couldn't do any location scouting? Was it cheaper just to go find this trailer somewhere and film in front of it? The caves themselves weren't too bad at least, but still not like the book.<br /><br />As is predictable, the little teenage romance love triangle is awkward and hard to watch (just like Twilight). You end up not caring about any of the characters in any capacity because the depth of the characters is so poor. Eventually I started rooting for the Seeker--which I did not do for the book.<br /><br />I don't like it when movies change the story so much. Have two guys commit suicide rather than be caught was pointless and never happened in the book. Neither is there a stupid glow worm cave in the American southwest. And the glowing eyes thing was highly distracting--it made it look like the aliens were blind. It was highly distracting and poorly done.<br /><br />The most obnoxious part is the voice over for Melanie. I don't know how they could've done it differently to make this sort of concept better on screen though, so maybe this is one of those books that just should not have been made into a movie.",1584645668863,negative

Ok, technically it does IF and ONLY IF you have AppleTV, which I don't. I wanted to put it on Vudu and it won't work. So I went to the link it told me to, and there I learned that you can only watch it on AppleTV. Lame.

1.0,"Like many other reviewers, it seems that the DVDs are poorly made and tend to freeze up your DVD player. I was able to watch the first episode with no problem all the way through. The second episode would freeze up a few minutes in, the third episode was the same, watched the fourth, and then either the fifth or six episode froze up the same way as 2 & 3. The only way to unfreeze my DVD player was to reach way under the entertainment center and unplug the player, which is a pain to say the least. After doing this half a dozen times today, I'm giving up and returning the set. I'm just glad I got to start watching them before the return window closed or else I'd be out over $50.<br /><br />This is a huge bummer.

This movie and soundtrack beats out both of those easily.<br /><br />It's a sweet film. I'm just sorry it took me so long to see it!,1527991455854,neutral
4.0,"Not a bad movie and a good amount of action. Gross factor too, which I strongly dislike, but it's still a good movie. Who doesn't love Tom? I love adventure movies.<br /><br />The hot-girl-along-for-the-ride story line is so overused and cliche though. I try to ignore her.",1527965126959,positive
4.0,"This is a pretty good movie. Not really high on the excitement scale--more of a drama to me--but there is some action and humor, too. I love the story.<br /><br />It can be a dark movie though in a lot of parts, so the blu-ray can help if you've got a good player and screen.",1527965013223,positive
4.0,"It's cute, good for a younger crowd I think. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did when I was kid. Such is life....still, it's always good to be expanding my Disney collection.",1527964330839,neutral
4.0,"I'm not a huge fan of the original Mummy series, so I wasn't that excited to see this one. I actually liked this one quite a bit. I found it entertaining and not boring like a lot of people did--maybe I'm just not as picky. It certainly kept my attention throughout the movie.",1514306772738,neutral
1.0,"The movies are great. The extras are so-so. What made me rate it so low is that the packaging automatically scratches the discs anytime you take it out or put it back in. I consider myself somewhat of a dvd nazi in that I take the discs out, put them in the player, then put them directly back into the cases so that none of my dvds get scratches on them. This book-style sleeved format forces you to get fingerprints on them just to get a grip on the discs, then you have to painfully yank it out of the sleeve. When you put it back in the sleeve you have to push just to get in there. It's no wonder the cardboard scratches the discs so badly. One by one my discs are becoming completely unwatchable. HUGE waste of money!",1470079656000,neutral
1.0,"Don't bother watching this movie if you've read the book (assuming you liked it). It deviates so far from it that the story is completely unrecognizable. There is hardly anything in this move that relates to the story in the book. The actors look bored, the script is crap, and the special effects are waaaay too over the top. And to think that there's still one more to go! I can see why they split HP into two, but for Twilight, HG, and Divergent it's just unnecessary. I'm glad I work at a video store and didn't have to pay to watch this drivel. I liked the first movie. The second was a little lame. But this one is just trash.<br /><br />And just one random thought: When, exactly, did Tris learn to walk in heels? Not in Abnegation and not in Dauntless!",1468450258000,positive
3.0,"I've done a number of Essentrics workouts with an instructor, so I thought I was prepared enough for this dvd. The Strength dvd though is too advanced for me and she goes way too fast. The Stretch dvd was better.<br /><br />However, the issue I have with the dvd's is that she isn't reminding you very well of what you need to do during the work out. Like reminding you to pull out of your hands or feet, to stretch-stretch-stretch, reminding you to keep &#34;tucking under&#34;, don't scrunch up your shoulders or hip, and things like that. These are all things my instructor is good at doing, and therefore get a MUCH better workout with her rather than the dvd's. It's hard to keep up and pay attention to all the different things on your own when you're not reminded. I was hoping that the dvd would be similar to my instructor's method of teaching, but it's not.<br /><br />Overall, I wish I hadn't bought this for how expensive it was and would just rather stick with the class I'm able to go to because I don't think I'll use the dvd very much. This was a my first dvd and I doubt I'll buy any other ones.<br /><br />One last thing---the room she is in does make it look back-lit, but this wasn't a problem for me with a newer tv. I think if you have an older, darker tv then it'll be a problem for you to see what she's doing with all the light behind her.",1438614696000,positive
5.0,"What an adorable movie. I don't usually go for romantic comedies, which I'm sure this one is classified as. But I probably like it because it's really more about LIFE than strictly about the romance. Wonderful movie with wonderful messages. Made me laugh AND cry!",1427140131000,neutral
1.0,"I went into this movie sort-of prepared for a movie about how man-is-evil and caused the destruction of earth and/or global warming catastrophe, etc.... and I was not disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't focused on &#34;global warming,&#34; but it was entirely about man destroying the earth because of &#34;cities&#34; and industrialization. Even not being a vegan or vegetarian in this movie is evil. Heaven forbid humans eat meat! Are all of the carnivores evil too? On top of that, right at the beginning of the movie a kid gets knocked just for picking a flower. Apparently picking wildflowers is a big no-no too, because that would undoubtedly lead to the destruction of earth, right? So they show expanses of land that have been ravaged, left as nothing but ash and clear-cut forests. I wonder what Noah, in this adaptation, would think of farmers and agriculture. He'd probably demonize that too since it's not simply gathering, which is how they lived. I found it remarkable how healthy they all were for living off of roots and berries their entire lives.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't quite expected such a twisted story related to the tale of Noah and the Ark. Rock giants, seriously? Cannibalistic &#34;men&#34;? Magic that the grandfather somehow used to heal the granddaughter? And I don't recall Noah being some misguided murderous fool thinking that he's doing the Creator's bidding by killing innocent babies.<br /><br />Overall this movie was both boring and exhausting. I am truly sorry for all the ignorant people out there who see this movie and then actually think it relates at all to the biblical story of Noah and the Ark.",1407686395000,negative
5.0,"Adorable movie! If the trailers had been better, I would've been glad to see it in theaters (we rented it instead). I didn't even realize it was Pixar until it came out on video!<br /><br />It had funny parts but the thing I loved most about it was how creative the movie was. Genius! I loved the video game world that they made and you can tell the animators had a fun time creating it too. Even for someone who isn't into video games (like me), it was a fantastic movie.",1363123416000,positive
5.0,"It was better than the first 3 movies combined, in my opinion. Both actors seemed to have finally gotten a comfortable handled on their characters and have become much better acting-wise. The movie hit on almost everything important in the [first half of the] book. No real complaints, would just like to see more and more!<br /><br />The only thing annoying about the dvd doesn't actually have to do with the movie. It takes a long time just to load in the dvd player, then you have to patiently hit the skip-forward button through two movie trailers just to get to the main menu because you can't simply hit the ""disc menu"" button right away. Annoying. I wish dvd's wouldn't force you to watch trailers if you don't want to--it'd be nice if they went straight to the menu or (God forbid) just played the movie automatically.",1337797221000,neutral
3.0,"I love Leverage, and I love every season except for this one. I love the cons and everyone in it but Jeri Ryan's role completely ruined it for me. I can't stand her! She's so trashy and outrageously arrogant. I can't watch these episodes because of her, and any time I try to I just end up changing the channel or doing something else instead. I hate missing out on almost an entire season because her character is so disgustingly awful. While the show is good, 3 stars is generous for having a whole season rendered un-watchable for me.",1333650961000,positive

1.0,"This was not a movie and does not deserve a rating.  It was a short, magnifying the obvious talent of these two actresses.  I would have rather watched them step in sh!!!.  At least they would know by the smell to avoid it. This film didn't even have a smell.  All I could say over and over and over again was,  WHY ????",1399401865000,neutral
